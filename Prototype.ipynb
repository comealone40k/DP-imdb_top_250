I&apos;ve never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she&apos;s in. It&apos;s not just the action sequences that she is great in, she&apos;s just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn&apos;t just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she&apos;s in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman&apos;s dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they&apos;re not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I&apos;m usually not a big fan of that, but here it works.

To protect each other, they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job, the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway.  As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover.  The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.\\n\\nWhen this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it&apos;s violence, even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while.  I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves.  Looking at the media&apos;s adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can&apos;t help but marvel at how things have changed.  Looking at Reservoir Dogs now (or even then!) it simply isn&apos;t THAT violent.  However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.\\n\\nTarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit.  The dialogue is both witty at points but, more importantly, very tough and loaded with testosterone.  It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath.  The entire job happens off camera, and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence - usually we get the aftermath.  It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout, I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film - it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best `job gone wrong&apos; films of my generation.  It may not be original (there&apos;s a thin line between a homage and a rip off) but it is certainly effectively done.\\n\\nThe cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes.  Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wide-eyed and freaking out for much of the film, but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it; it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well, despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great, maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting, as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.\\n\\nTarantino mercifully has little acting to do, but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well - mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene, it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what - it is tight and tense, macho, violent, funny and very enjoyable.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1010468, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': '18', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '1992-09-02', 'keywords': 'heist gone wrong,nonlinear timeline,neo noir,mexican standoff,robbery', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Reservoir Dogs: 10th Anniversary Edition', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3028484377', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3028484377/', 'description': 'Home Video Trailer from Artisan', 'duration': 'PT2M3S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T15:52:06Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000172/', 'name': 'Harvey Keitel'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000619/', 'name': 'Tim Roth'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000514/', 'name': 'Michael Madsen'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000233/', 'name': 'Quentin Tarantino'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0049954/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0112857/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000233/', 'name': 'Quentin Tarantino'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000812/', 'name': 'Roger Avary'}], 'duration': 'PT1H39M'}\n",

You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.\\n\\n This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan&apos;s Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen&apos;s Aragorn, and Sean Bean&apos;s Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, &apos;no, that&apos;s not right&apos;, however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett&apos;s performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.\\n\\nI thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.\\n\\n However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in &quot;The Matrix&quot;), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can&apos;t fault an action film for being an action film.\\n\\n This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don&apos;t get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don&apos;t particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien&apos;s vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1856164, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.8}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '2002-01-10', 'keywords': 'ring,quest,hobbit,middle earth,epic', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi684573465', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ2YjI2YzgtZmNmMy00ZjUyLWE0NGItY2Y3NjUzZWM4NmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ2YjI2YzgtZmNmMy00ZjUyLWE0NGItY2Y3NjUzZWM4NmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi684573465/', 'description': 'A shy young hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a simple gold ring.

And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.\\n\\nThis isn&apos;t to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant.

Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of.  The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating.  Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can&apos;t seem to grasp.  As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on.  And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense.  To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.\\n\\nBut no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one&apos;s expectations.

And who is Rey?? why do we know nothing about the lead character in the film after an entire movie??????? and why is kylo ren named Ben if he is Leia and Han&apos;s son? in the extended universe there were 4 grandchildren of Vader, Ben Skywalker, Jaina solo,anakin solo and jacen solo who would turn to be Darth caedus. Or what about the lost armada? I feel like Disney destroyed the saga because it doesn&apos;t offer or expand anything new, and just reuses the same plot from the previous episodes!! anyways i don&apos;t feel like ranting anymore because there is nothing left to say other than this movie is a rehashed turd! IF YOU HATE THIS MOVIE LIKE MY COMMENT PLEASE!!! Also don&apos;t believe what rotten tomatoes and IMDb rate this film, its a terrible mindless movie.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 4}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 926063, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 7.8}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '2015-12-18', 'keywords': 'reboot,sanitation employee,crash landing,wisecrack humor,sewer cleaner', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Watch With a STARZ Free Trial', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2762323481', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNTcyNjM3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwOTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNTcyNjM3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwOTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2762323481/', 'description': 'Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises.

In a way, it&apos;s a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat&apos; Western.\\n\\nThe three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad&apos;) is evil personified.  Totally ruthless, he&apos;ll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good&apos;) is the Man With No Name, not really `good&apos; in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly&apos;) is Tuco, and he&apos;s easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood&apos;s best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly&apos; side of people.\\n\\nThe movie is long, but there&apos;s not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what&apos;s going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone&apos;s masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone&apos;s score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone&apos;s powerful score. \\n\\nThis movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven&apos;t seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven&apos; . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven&apos; is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it&apos;s the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&apos; is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they&apos;re a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O&apos; Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they&apos;ll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden&apos;s (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she&apos;s an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song &amp; dance girl at an industry party he&apos;s attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he&apos;s too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1993).\\n\\nAside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they&apos;re worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren&apos;t written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan&apos;s showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It&apos;s also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.\\n\\nBut the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and dénouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor&apos;s careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.\\n\\nBut Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they&apos;re showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.\\n\\nDonen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the &quot;Make &apos;Em Laugh&quot; sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended &quot;Broadway Rhythm Ballet&quot; sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it&apos;s just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly&apos;s umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, &quot;rain&quot; is pouring down on him.\\n\\nWhile there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you&apos;re relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 241869, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': 'G', 'genre': ['Comedy', 'Musical', 'Romance'], 'datePublished': '1964-07-16', 'keywords': 'movie studio,1920s,film within a film,femme fatale,hollywood california', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Singin&apos; in the Rain', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2086470681', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiYWE0YzAtNDNjYi00NzE0LWEyNWItNTA2MDcyZmIyMTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiYWE0YzAtNDNjYi00NzE0LWEyNWItNTA2MDcyZmIyMTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2086470681/', 'description': 'Trailer for the classic musical Singin&apos; in the Rain, starring Gene Kelly, Donald O&apos;Connor, and Debbie Reynolds.

It&apos;s been around for nearly fifty years, and is widely regarded as not just one the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time, but one of the best Westerns full stop. And it&apos;s not hard to see why: an incredible soundtrack, strong performances from the entire main cast, some surprisingly good humour and funny one-liners, a few tense sequences, a well-told story that doesn&apos;t rely on excessive dialogue or exposition, and consistently amazing cinematography and direction throughout. At least half the frames in this movie would probably make good paintings- no exaggeration.\\n\\nIt&apos;s probably the marriage of the great visuals and soundtrack that make Once Upon a Time in the West work as well as it does. There&apos;s a good number of dramatic camera movements and interesting reveals that are tied up perfectly with the music- almost like some kind of singing-free musical at some points.\\n\\nSergio Leone was one of the greatest directors of all time. It&apos;s a real shame that he apparently never got the kind of recognition he gets nowadays while he was still alive. Out of all his films, there&apos;s a strong argument to be made for this one being the closest to perfect. Honestly, there&apos;s not a lot that could be changed to make it better. My biggest direct gripe is the way the title pops up at the very end of the film, and rotates in a full circle before it disappears. It looks really cheesy, and comes close to killing the mood the otherwise extremely strong ending creates. While we&apos;re on complaints, another minor one would be that I want to say the film feels a little too long- maybe about 10 to 15 minutes. But at the same time, I wouldn&apos;t really know what to cut. Every scene is so well-constructed and orchestrated, and there&apos;s always something interesting to look at or listen to or think about, so I&apos;m not really sure what should be cut. It&apos;s a pretty weak complaint, I know. Like I said, this thing&apos;s close to perfect.\\n\\nThe Good The Bad and The Ugly might be a tiny bit more entertaining, and Once Upon a Time in America might have a slightly better soundtrack and stronger emotional moments (for me, personally), but it&apos;s still really hard to find much to complain about here.

Its love story, poignant and comic elements have inspired, in no specific order, René Clair (&apos;Le Million&apos;), Jean Vigo (&apos;L&apos;Atalante&apos;, &apos;Zéro de conduite&apos;), Charlie Chaplin (all his subsequent films), Fellini (&apos;La Strada&apos;, &apos;Nights of Cabiria&apos;) and even James Cameron (&apos;Titanic&apos;).\\n\\nThe camera is extremely mobile (more so than in most of today&apos;s films, except maybe The Matrix) and the acting is superb.

Margaret Livingston (who she?) is also quite realistic as a believably enticing city girl vamp (of modest means) who tries to lure the hero away from his deserving wife.\\n\\nThe DVD has more extras than a Criterion issue, including a tentative reconstruction of Murnau&apos;s missing American masterpiece &apos;The Four Devils&apos; (a circus love story) and the entire shooting scripts of both &apos;Sunrise&apos; and &apos;The Four Devils&apos;.\\n\\n&apos;Sunrise&apos; is presented with two soundtracks: the original (mono) Movietone (i.e. optical track) anonymous composite soundtrack cobbled together from several sources (think Wagner&apos;s Siegfried Idyll) and a newly written and recorded (stereo) score with all-original themes, that closely follows the original in spirit but not in melody.\\n\\nBoth soundtracks try to add an intimate, poetic dimension to the film, which is subtitled &apos;A Song of Two Humans&apos;. The music is an integral part of the experience as the film is conceived as a tone poem and, as such (my theory) is a kind of transcription for the masses of Schoenberg&apos;s 1900 string ensemble tone poem &apos;Verklärte Nacht&apos; (Transfigured Night), a late-Romantic/early expressionist attempt to describe musically the &apos;truly profound and authentic&apos; relationship between a man and a woman who have problems (the music follows a poem of the era).\\n\\nBoth soundtracks succeed admirably, my preference going to the new one, despite the original&apos;s polish, historical value and magnificent preservation. And that would be because, although in the silent era there was no stigma attached to accompanying silent movies with a score made up of public domain and rather recognizable pieces, as long as they fit the mood, times have changed (&apos;2001, A Space Odyssey&apos; notwithstanding) and this practice is more distracting than anything for a contemporary, moderately educated spectator.\\n\\nMurnau had very highbrow ambitions but his film is totally clear and populist and made to reach the widest popular audience thanks to the incredible sums of money and artistry that Fox poured in the project. 20th Century Fox basically imported a genius from Germany, gave him a ton of money and told him: &apos;Make us a movie that will be the most prestigious ever made in this town and that will win us the first Oscar&apos;. And that&apos;s just what he did!\\n\\nNeedless to say, that was a long time before Rupert Murdoch took over the Fox Corporation...', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 51228, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Romance'], 'datePublished': '1928-01-05', 'keywords': 'silent film,storm,rainstorm,farmer,murder plot', 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0639563/', 'name': 'George O&apos;Brien'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0310980/', 'name': 'Janet Gaynor'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0515272/', 'name': 'Margaret Livingston'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0003638/', 'name': 'F.W.

This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. \\n\\nThe film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. \\n\\nThe two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I&apos;m not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. \\n\\nAfter that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). \\n\\nWe are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here – the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. \\n\\nThe casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame – only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt – Lord Hesketh, &quot;Bubbles&quot; Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. \\n\\nThe love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt&apos;s first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame – as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. \\n\\nThe attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film &quot;feels&quot; like it&apos;s happening in the 70&apos;s. \\n\\nFor anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70&apos;s, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 478152, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Action', 'Biography', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '2013-09-12', 'keywords': 'formula 1,rivalry,1970s,racecar driver,nurburgring germany', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'UK Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1998301465', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzA0MzkyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxNjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzA0MzkyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxNjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1998301465/', 'description': 'From Ron Howard comes an exhilarating true story of two legendary rivals James Hunt and Niki Lauda, starring Chris Hemsworth.', 'duration': 'PT2M34S', 'uploadDate': '2013-08-24T11:38:49Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0117709/', 'name': 'Daniel Brühl'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1165110/', 'name': 'Chris Hemsworth'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1312575/', 'name': 'Olivia Wilde'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000165/', 'name': 'Ron Howard'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0234935/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0285648/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0003687/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0604948/', 'name': 'Peter Morgan'}], 'duration': 'PT2H3M'}\n",

This film is definitely the one to do so in the superhero genre.\\n\\nGood : There&apos;s a whole bunch of good things that I can talk about. Bryan Singer does his best to tell the story, considering the comparatively weak script for an experimental film like this. This was the first time in YEARS that a superhero film was taken seriously. Given that there had been no introduction to any of the characters prior to this film, it does a really good job to make them interesting. Plus, it establishes the conflict between Eric and Xavier, which have been an integral part of many films that came afterwards. Not to mention, the character introduction, especially that of Wolverine, was incredible. We instantly know the basic characterization given to each of them, which was enough to get behind the movie. Hugh Jackman was the optimal choice for the role of Wolverine, and he proved it for next 17 years. Every single actor have done a good job in their roles. Also, I believe that X-Men films have been the best superhero films when it comes to &quot;social&quot; themes. We get to see the first of many times two friends with different world views clashing with one another. It has grown incredibly stale now, but was great to see back then and some other films after this, especially First Class and DoFP. The mutants wanting to be accepted by humans, and the other mutants wanting to destroy mankind - what other superhero series have given such a theme, or a similar one? This movie is the reason we are getting films like Infinity War, Civil War, Endgame, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. While I prefer these over the first X-Men movie, if it didn&apos;t bring the genre back on track, we would&apos;ve never gotten such films.\\n\\nMixed : It feels dated. Had it been made today, it would&apos;ve been a lackluster. It was clear that they were trying to experiment with this movie and still figuring out how to get things right. While they got most of the things right, they could&apos;ve made the story a little more complex.\\n\\nBad : The story is quite a bit of a throwaway story. While there&apos;s an interesting twist, it still feels like the movie becomes a little goofy and cartoony after that twist. Some moments feel like they were shoehorned just to give some &quot;comic accuracy&quot;, but they didn&apos;t feel justified. I believe that if you get the basic elements right, it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s not deadly accurate with the comics. But if you want it to be so, make some baseline for that. Don&apos;t do it randomly.\\n\\nConclusion : It&apos;s a movie that set the genre back on track forever. While the story and script might feel a little lazy when viewed today, you can see that the execution of the ideas were as good as humanly possible. If you are a superhero movie fan, it&apos;s a must watch. Not because it&apos;s insanely great, but just as a reminder of what led us to where we are. I am a huge fan of the genre. All credits go to Nolan&apos;s Batman films, the good X-Men films and Raimi&apos;s first two Spider-Man films. I absolutely love the MCU and many DC films apart from Nolan&apos;s trilogy - Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Shazam, The Dark Knight Returns, Superman/Doomsday, etc. But for me, like for the genre, it all started with the first X-Men movie. So, I have a very special place for this in my heart, as a fan.\\n\\nRating.\\n\\nScore : 8/10\\n\\nGrade : A-', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 614565, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 7.3}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '2000-11-02', 'keywords': 'mutant,superhero,superhero team,logan character,erik lehnsherr character', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'U.S. Version', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi339519001', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODQ1NjA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAxMDIyMzE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODQ1NjA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAxMDIyMzE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi339519001/', 'description': 'Two mutants come to a private academy for mutants whose resident superhero team must oppose a powerful mutant terrorist organization.\\r\\n', 'duration': 'PT2M31S', 'uploadDate': '2013-04-30T19:32:04Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001772/', 'name': 'Patrick Stewart'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0413168/', 'name': 'Hugh Jackman'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0005212/', 'name': 'Ian McKellen'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001741/', 'name': 'Bryan Singer'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0000756/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0095134/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0001946/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0220892/', 'name': 'Tom DeSanto'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001741/', 'name': 'Bryan Singer'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0371684/', 'name': 'David Hayter'}], 'duration': 'PT1H44M'}\n",

It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.\\n\\nHaley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character&apos;s soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.\\n\\nBruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.\\n\\nThe Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.

It&apos;s the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&apos;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&apos;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA.

Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare&apos;s King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. \\n\\nThe story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son&apos;s audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son&apos;s impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. \\n\\nThe brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can&apos;t help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn&apos;t feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa&apos;s brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. \\n\\nA must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema.

Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.\\n\\nSergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).\\n\\nUncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.\\n\\nThus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan&apos;s Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.\\n\\nApparently Pan&apos;s Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film&apos;s magical dreamworld that haven&apos;t been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film&apos;s depiction of the Civil War that can&apos;t be read in Satre or Orwell; can&apos;t be viewed in Picasso&apos;s Guernica; or can&apos;t be watched in Land and Freedom.\\n\\nFor all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, which doesn&apos;t lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan&apos;s Labyrinth in a way that most won&apos;t watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death \\x96 a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I&apos;ve seen.\\n\\nThe only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I&apos;ve seen this year, and a must see on the big screen.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 666236, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'War'], 'datePublished': '2007-03-08', 'keywords': 'fairy,maze,spain,labyrinth,hiding', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Tráiler [OV]', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1876343321', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQzZWZkMGYtNGZkOC00YzlkLTk5MTEtYjQzNzJmY2NkMGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQzZWZkMGYtNGZkOC00YzlkLTk5MTEtYjQzNzJmY2NkMGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1876343321/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT1M50S', 'uploadDate': '2018-11-30T10:00:04.737Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1419440/', 'name': 'Ivana Baquero'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0317725/', 'name': 'Ariadna Gil'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0530365/', 'name': 'Sergi López'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0868219/', 'name': 'Guillermo del Toro'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0040776/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0016173/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0816169/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0868219/', 'name': 'Guillermo del Toro'}], 'duration': 'PT1H58M'}\n",

Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what&apos;s going on. I&apos;ll start off by saying that I&apos;m not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I&apos;ve seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don&apos;t expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he&apos;s on screen you can&apos;t take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I&apos;m usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love.

It&apos;s not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can&apos;t speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there&apos;s no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house&apos; has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman&apos;s head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I&apos;ve seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD&apos;s flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody&apos;s job often was), I&apos;d be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won!

It&apos;s not that I can&apos;t think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.\\n\\nI saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn&apos;t have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.\\n\\nThe &apos;milk-money&apos; scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.\\n\\nThis movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend&apos;s shoulder.\\n\\nI guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you&apos;ll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, &quot;a great time&quot;\\n\\nI especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.\\n\\n&quot;I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?&quot;'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 402356, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'R', 'genre': ['Adventure', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1986-08-22', 'keywords': 'coming of age,friendship,childhood friend,treehouse,boy', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Stand By Me', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2284829721', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2284829721/', 'description': 'Official Trailer', 'duration': 'PT1M15S', 'uploadDate': '2019-06-29T17:16:55.655Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000696/', 'name': 'Wil Wheaton'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000203/', 'name': 'River Phoenix'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000397/', 'name': 'Corey Feldman'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001661/', 'name': 'Rob Reiner'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0050868/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0015549/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0043140/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000175/', 'name': 'Stephen King'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0317279/', 'name': 'Raynold Gideon'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0262595/', 'name': 'Bruce A.

This is pretty much what an action gangster flick should be like. It has all the required ingredients. The action, humour, drama and suspense balance extremely well. Ritchie&apos;s writing and direction are excellent as not only does the film keep one at the edge of his/her seat but the characters (including minor ones) are rich. They&apos;re over-the-top but that only works for the film. While the bad guys think they&apos;re powerful and all, they&apos;re actually portrayed as dumb and the good guys think they&apos;re clever and have all the answers to their problems when they&apos;re actually not so bright. The characters are portrayed as cool yet they end up getting caught in a mess. The film too is somewhat satirical as it reflects a part of life e.g. the closeness between the four friends, the son following the father&apos;s (Big Chris&apos;s) footsteps. The humour is mostly dark with sharp, witty and funny dialogues and hilarious situations. It all seems a &apos;natural&apos; part of the story. Shot in DV, the camera-work and use of music is very effective. The film has a raw and gritty look yet the execution of it makes it very stylish. Richie uses the same style in &apos;Snatch&apos;. He should become an auteur and make more movies of this kind as it is clearly his fort (remember his disastrous attempt at romance with &apos;Swept Away&apos;?). All the actors, whether it&apos;s Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham or more recognized faces like Vinnie Jones and Sting, seem to naturally fit their parts. &apos;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&apos; is one of the coolest &apos;gangster&apos; flicks.

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.\\n\\nThe plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.\\n\\nThis is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.\\n\\nThis spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.\\n\\nThe story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.\\n\\nThe special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.\\n\\nYounger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.\\n\\nI highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.\\n\\nWatch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.\\n\\nEnjoy', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 981585, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '1993-09-24', 'keywords': 'dinosaur,scientist,bipedal dinosaur,tyrannosaurus rex,sneeze', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': '3D Re-Release Version', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi177055257', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NzI2MTg2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc2MzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NzI2MTg2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc2MzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi177055257/', 'description': ' During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.

Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\\n\\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I&apos;ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I&apos;ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\\n\\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen&apos;s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won&apos;t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp&apos;s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she&apos;s in.\\n\\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children&apos;s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\\n\\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund&apos;s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer&apos;s imagination, which chill to the bone.\\n\\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn&apos;t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\\n\\n&quot;The Hunt&quot; was easily the saddest film I&apos;ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It&apos;s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that&apos;s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\\n\\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but &quot;The Hunt&quot; is one of the most affecting and emotional films I&apos;ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 328119, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama'], 'datePublished': '2013-02-21', 'keywords': 'kindergarten teacher,friendship between men,punched in the face,divorced man,gun', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Theatrical Version', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2244519449', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTk2MTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY0MDAzMzE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTk2MTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY0MDAzMzE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2244519449/', 'description': 'A teacher lives a lonely life, all the while struggling over his son&apos;s custody.

It was my introduction to the great Billy Wilder, and my fondness for Jack Lemmon (a remarkable and sorely missed actor) begins here as well.\\n\\n*SOME SPOILERS* \\n\\nThe cold take on the sex-and-money ethos to be found in many corporate environments hasn&apos;t dated one bit; it could be argued that THE APARTMENT stands a bit ahead of its&apos; time in the depiction of (what would appear to be) educated employees treated like (and feeling like) tools to be used in generation of someone else&apos;s income. Lemmon&apos;s character never forgets that he&apos;s disposable, even if the optimist in him hopes that something better may be found in his superiors. Deep down he knows this to be a pipe dream - the sexual adventurism of those same superiors betrays their utter lack of ethics. Of course, Lemmon&apos;s character isn&apos;t entirely above it all; he&apos;s been more than willing to hire out his own apartment as a place for his colleagues&apos; peccadilloes, in exchange for career advancement, which of course - as Wilder early on links amoral sexual conduct and professional/corporate/financial misconduct in a greater social critique - gets him into trouble.\\n\\nThe dialogue is - as is always true with Wilder - very finely crafted, yet seems natural - this film is a remarkable display of the kind of reactions any of us would offer in similar situations. Interestingly, our two protagonists are also wonderfully imperfect as human beings - Lemmon and MacLaine bear some responsibility for the very serious situations they&apos;ve gotten themselves into; they manage to realize this (&quot;Be a mensch!&quot; Lemmon&apos;s doctor neighbor exclaims) just in time to set things right. MacLaine in particular delivers a remarkable, complex performance - sweet and smart in her earliest scenes, bleak and emotionally ravaged in her climactic scene with MacMurray, naive elsewhere, sharp but hopeful at the end. The cinematography captures the entire cast beautifully - with minimal movement, abundant long takes, and a sleek lack of visual clutter, all of the principals are free to reveal their own best and worst impulses, within an environment that is stripped of artifice. The end result is a film filled with great moments one can easily identify with.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 181386, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': '18', 'genre': ['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance'], 'datePublished': '1961-07-27', 'keywords': 'christmas,apartment,mirror,evidence,catching a cold', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1746125337', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjdlYmIwMTgtMzE3ZS00NzlkLThmYjUtYWZiYWM3NmEzNjA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjdlYmIwMTgtMzE3ZS00NzlkLThmYjUtYWZiYWM3NmEzNjA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1746125337/', 'description': 'A Manhattan insurance clerk tries to rise in his company by letting its executives use his apartment for trysts, but complications and a romance of his own ensue.', 'duration': 'PT2M20S', 'uploadDate': '2022-07-27T18:01:54.692Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000493/', 'name': 'Jack Lemmon'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000511/', 'name': 'Shirley MacLaine'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0534045/', 'name': 'Fred MacMurray'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000697/', 'name': 'Billy Wilder'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0011112/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000697/', 'name': 'Billy Wilder'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0224634/', 'name': 'I.A.L.

Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a &quot;cleaner&quot;, or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.\\n\\nThe performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.\\n\\nJean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.\\n\\nThe Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie.

Perhaps not as dark, cruel and shoking as &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) or &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) still manages to be called a timeless classic.\\n\\nFirst of all, Scottie&apos;s condition allowed the use of an entirely new camera technique. &quot;The Dolly Zoom&quot; is one of cinematography&apos;s most impressive camera tricks. Years before Steven Spielberg used it in &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), Irmin Roberts was the first cameraman to ever use this technique, in a Hitchcock film.\\n\\nThis movie tells the story of Scottie, a retired cop who&apos;s asked to investigate the case of his friend&apos;s wife, which seems to be possesed by the spirit of a dead young woman who committed suicide.\\n\\nAs the chilling story goes on, several moments of suspense accompanied by chilling musical scores are happening. If you&apos;re not a fan of it, you can still enjoy the superb settings throughout the movie, and as well the beautifuly filmed shots. These elements alone are a pure work of art in my opinion.\\n\\nBecause it&apos;s a 50&apos;s film, you will encounter extravagant dialogue between the characters, that still manages to look natural.

The vision they have somehow doesn&apos;t translate to the screen, or it&apos;s not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren&apos;t gifted with writing or directing talent. That&apos;s certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. \\n\\nNot too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn&apos;t even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.\\n\\nWhen Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.\\n\\nWill Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he&apos;s constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he&apos;s a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.\\n\\nWhich perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon&apos;s genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.\\n\\nRobin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.\\n\\nSome of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film&apos;s key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don&apos;t use it and move up and on, you&apos;re the stupidest guy here. It&apos;s one of Affleck&apos;s best scenes in his whole career on film.\\n\\nI&apos;ve known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn&apos;t work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.\\n\\nHe also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn&apos;t sing militant songs of protest he wasn&apos;t interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.\\n\\nUnlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn&apos;t reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I&apos;m sure they won&apos;t mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he&apos;s alive or no longer with us. \\n\\nI&apos;m sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we&apos;ve all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 959254, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Romance'], 'datePublished': '1999-02-25', 'keywords': 'professor,genius,mathematical genius,loss of wife,friend', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Good Will Hunting', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1281211929', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc2MjE1YTItNWIyYy00YTA4LWE1MWMtODA0MDM1NTVlNjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc2MjE1YTItNWIyYy00YTA4LWE1MWMtODA0MDM1NTVlNjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1281211929/', 'description': 'Official Trailer', 'duration': 'PT2M21S', 'uploadDate': '2020-08-18T17:03:30.607Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000245/', 'name': 'Robin Williams'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000354/', 'name': 'Matt Damon'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000255/', 'name': 'Ben Affleck'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001814/', 'name': 'Gus Van Sant'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0022594/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0031032/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0093776/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000354/', 'name': 'Matt Damon'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000255/', 'name': 'Ben Affleck'}], 'duration': 'PT2H6M'}\n",

Although the underlying theme of this movie is aging and impending death, the movie is NOT all pessimism. If it had been, it would have lost my interest early on. Instead, I really enjoyed the film--particularly the fine acting by Victor Sjöström as Professor Borg.\\n\\nThe professor is well-respected for his work as a doctor. However, despite his success in his career, he is a failure in his personal relationships. His emotional baggage over the years has prevented him from allowing himself to be close to those he truly loves. This theme mirrors one of the subplots of Through a Glass Darkly, where a father is being destroyed inside by his daughter&apos;s mental illness but he CANNOT allow himself to show his anguish--choosing instead to hide in his room with his tears. It is interesting that the same man playing Borg&apos;s son (Gunnar Björnstrand) plays the father only a few years later in Through a Glass Darkly.\\n\\nFortunately, unlike Through a Glass Darkly, there IS evidence that the professor is willing to change his persona, as he begins to open up more through the course of the movie. This appears to be assisted through extensive soul searching and dreams the professor has concerning his past and his own mortality--along with experiences he has during a long drive down the coast of Sweden. Because of this, even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears to hold some hope of improvement by the film&apos;s end. This hope for change lifts this movie above some Bergman films that only wallow in hopelessness.\\n\\nFYI--The Criterion version of this DVD is nice due to its running commentary as well as the accompanying documentary.

It&apos;s one of those classics like &apos;Citizen Kane&apos;, &apos;Rear Window&apos; or &apos;The Godfather&apos; that has subtlety entered popular culture, so even if you haven&apos;t actually seen it you recognize references to it in other movies, TV, magazines and everyday conversation. The thing is like the aforementioned and &apos;Rashomon&apos; and &apos;Sunset Blvd&apos; it isn&apos;t regarded as a masterpiece for nothing, it really is one. I think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by &apos;The Seventh Seal&apos;. It&apos;s still one of the most extraordinary movies ever made. Visually it&apos;s stunning, the acting is first rate, and the end result is mesmerizing. Once seen never forgotten is a cliche, but it&apos;s the perfect description for this amazing film. Max von Sydow brilliantly plays Antonius Block, a knight returning from the Crusades who challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a chess match. He is accompanied on his journey home by his cynical squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Jons is my favourite character in the movie, and as good as von Sydow is Bjornstrand&apos;s performance is even better. I also was very taken by the traveling actors who become part of Block&apos;s entourage, Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and confess to developing quite a crush on Mia.

Don&apos;t be put off by Bergman&apos;s highbrow reputation, this is a movie that can be appreciated by anybody, especially by old school horror fans.

Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.\\n\\nBased on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy&apos;s intention, as he believes the conditions in a &quot;crazy house&quot; will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it&apos;s desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.\\n\\nJack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in &apos;Chinatown&apos; or &apos;As Good as it Gets&apos;. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can&apos;t help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.\\n\\nWhat can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest which hasn&apos;t already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it&apos;s glorious entirety. It&apos;s hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.\\n\\n-10/10', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1001354, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.7}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama'], 'datePublished': '1977-05-19', 'keywords': 'nurse,escape,native american,mental illness,hospitalization', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3943282969', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcyYTlhYzgtOWY4Yi00NjZmLThhY2YtYWJjNjk2ODcyOWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcyYTlhYzgtOWY4Yi00NjZmLThhY2YtYWJjNjk2ODcyOWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3943282969/', 'description': 'A criminal pleads insanity after getting into trouble again and once in the mental institution rebels against the oppressive nurse and rallies up the scared patients.', 'duration': 'PT2M35S', 'uploadDate': '2017-09-08T01:58:01Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000197/', 'name': 'Jack Nicholson'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001221/', 'name': 'Louise Fletcher'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0077720/', 'name': 'Michael Berryman'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001232/', 'name': 'Milos Forman'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0066949/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0068126/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0046377/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0369142/', 'name': 'Lawrence Hauben'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0325743/', 'name': 'Bo Goldman'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0450181/', 'name': 'Ken Kesey'}], 'duration': 'PT2H13M'}\n",

But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge.

Kazan led a cast of solid talent in a morality play amidst the backdrop of the Depression-era New York waterfront.  Brando, much calmer than in his mercurial performance in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (also directed by Kazan), personifies the best in &quot;Method&quot; acting, perfectly engaging the viewer with his genuineness as Terry Malloy.\\n\\nIn the most famous scene, Brando, a has-been prizefighter, confronts his brother (Steiger) who is about to set him up to be executed by the mob bosses of the union.  When Steiger reveals his intent to set Brando up, the scene explodes with reality and pathos.  Brando&apos;s words, &quot;Wow&quot;, sum up the intensity and emotion of the scene.\\n\\nGreat acting and directing, however, cannot cover up the transparent political/apologetical intent of the movie.  Two years earlier, Kazan had sold out his integrity to the House Unamerican Affairs Committee (HUAC), &quot;naming names&quot; of those who would become the blacklisted Hollywood 10. Kazan, a former communist himself, regretted his involvement with the Party, and evidently decided it was politically advantageous to name his former associates.  Likewise, Brando character Malloy finds himself in a mob-run labor union, and in his effort to &apos;get out&apos;, repeats much of what Kazan did in real life.  Worse, Kazan, through the allegorical message of the film, brands his former writers as criminals and murders, and himself as the naive innocent.  Being a communist was no crime in the 30s, and he was no innocent.\\n\\n&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; is thus steeped in a right-wing political worldview. Mobs run labor unions.  Unions are thus corrupt organizations who exploit workers and make it harder for businesses to thrive.  Turn in union leaders into the police.  Even the church becomes a tool of the state to further the cause of the police against the union.\\n\\nBrando was never satisfied with &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.  In fact, he later commented that it was indeed a tool for Kazan to justify his actions to the HUAC.

It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand&apos;s Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they&apos;re all stuck in. Clouzot&apos;s directing is flawless - I don&apos;t think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg&apos;s early gem, &quot;The Duel&quot;, but Clouzot&apos;s automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I&apos;ve ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don&apos;t see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 61359, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '1955-08-04', 'keywords': 'oil company,unemployment,oil,risk,vibration', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer [English SUB]', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi508608281', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWU5Zjk4MDAtZDM1Ni00YzJmLTkyZTUtYjVhN2VjNzZmOGVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWU5Zjk4MDAtZDM1Ni00YzJmLTkyZTUtYjVhN2VjNzZmOGVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi508608281/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT2M42S', 'uploadDate': '2020-01-29T03:46:11.183Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0598971/', 'name': 'Yves Montand'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0889024/', 'name': 'Charles Vanel'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0886870/', 'name': 'Peter van Eyck'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0167241/', 'name': 'Henri-Georges Clouzot'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0002264/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0010228/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0132005/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1064118/', 'name': 'Georges Arnaud'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0167241/', 'name': 'Henri-Georges Clouzot'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0350823/', 'name': 'Jérôme Géronimi'}], 'duration': 'PT2H11M'}\n",

Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and \\n\\nJay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he&apos;s deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent.\\n\\nIn a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it&apos;s a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup&apos;s secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation.\\n\\nThe story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup&apos;s peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there&apos;s the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don&apos;t fully comprehend, but it&apos;s the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first.\\n\\nFor those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I&apos;m betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its &quot;stitch&quot;-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it&apos;s co-director Chris Sander&apos;s previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that&apos;s always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well.\\n\\nAction junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\\n\\nHow to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year&apos;s Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight.

The stories about it&apos;s making are legendary from the constant rewrites to the apocrypha of casting stories.\\n\\nWhat is amazing to me, and the reason I believe it holds audiences almost spellbound in successive viewings, is the connection with the horrors of World War II was almost every single cast member.  Sidney Greenstreet had lost a son in combat, and a number of the cast members fled Europe to escape the ravages of a Hitler regime.  Even the evil Nazi character Major Strasser (played with relish by Conrad Veidt) had left Nazi Germany to escape  almost sure internment and possible death in a concentration camp. Here was a man who was a legend in German film history as the murdering somnambulist (a possible warning about the Nazi soldiers to come?) and because of the vicious anti-Semitism and racism of the Germany of the &apos;30s and &apos;40s, we in America and in Hollywood were given a great gift.\\n\\nEveryone in this film is fabulous, but it is the chemistry of Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) been truly holds the film together.  When I saw this film almost frame by frame in the limited book series of classic films that were produced in the late 1960s, I was stunned by the subtlety of facial expressions that conveyed so much of Rick Blaine&apos;s character by a marvelous actor Humphrey Bogart.  There is a reason why he was named the actor of the century.\\n\\nWhile every person in the film becomes a real flesh and blood presence, the story of Rick and Ilsa is the center of this cinema feast.\\n\\nI must confess that I have seen this picture so many times that I can recite every single line in the movie to the consternation of my wife who can&apos;t watch it with me anymore. \\n\\nThe line that sticks out the most for me, and which against cheers from New Yorkers whenever it plays in the theater.  It is when Bogart says to the Nazis seated at his table, &quot;There are parts of New York I wouldn&apos;t advise you to invade.&quot;  And what makes this line so memorable is that Humphrey Bogart did indeed star in another motion picture for Warner Brothers where that very thing formed the basis for the script.  That movie was &quot;All Through The Night.&quot; I love this movie too, and I&apos;m not even a New Yorker.\\n\\nThere have been many attempts to revisit &quot;Casablanca,&quot; but only the original makes you really feel what it was like to live through &quot;The Good War&quot; in a faraway place like Casablanca in French Morocco.\\n\\nEven  though such trickery as midget airport workers, fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized, this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers, and characters that are so well realized.\\n\\nIf you&apos;ve never seen this movie before, shame on you and see it immediately. If you only seen it once, I believe you will come back to it more than once. This is just about the most perfect film ever made and it is a miracle that that is so considering that there were so many hands in the pie.  (Excuse me for my mixing my metaphors.

And boy, am I glad I did! \\n\\nAs far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.\\n\\nThe story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase &quot;emotions are what makes us human&quot;! \\n\\nI recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.\\n\\nCertainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy&apos;s &quot;A-ha&quot; moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.\\n\\nIn terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind&apos;s performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.\\n\\nInside Out is every bit a Pixar fan&apos;s well-deserved reward for patience.

Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.&quot;\\n\\nThis quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film &quot;Gandhi&quot;.  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi&apos;s assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi&apos;s funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.\\n\\n Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  &quot;Gandhi&quot; serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.\\n\\n Ben Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the &quot;big-time actor&quot; persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.\\n\\nThe cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed &quot;Gandhi&quot; on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.\\n\\nThis movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; for that).

They are married and head to Manderley , the familiar mansion (in the exterior actually is a scale model). But Maxim is haunted by the ghost first wife , an enigmatic Rebecca , who died in mysterious circumstances . There works as a servant the creepy and obsessive housekeeper , Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson,a famous stage actress in her most important role) and sh meets a cynic gentleman (George Sanders).\\n\\nThis film has suspense , romance , unlimited tension , full of lingering images and with the typical touches Hitchcock . Besides , a literately and thoughtful dialog signed by Joan Harrison (Hitchcock&apos;s usual screenwriter) though lacking humor . After ¨39 steps¨and ¨Jamaica Inn¨ , Hitch was encouraged to go to America and promptly shot his first work in Hollywood hired by the great producer David O&apos;Selznick . Fine performance by Laurence Olivier , he married Vivien Leigh and he wished to her as protagonist but Hitch hired Joan Fontaine who took seven rehearsal sessions until the engaging . Joan Fontaine as a shy bride young is superb and enjoyable . Judith Anderson as a spooky and cold house keeper is top-notch, her role as obsessed person by the glamorous Rebecca is unforgotten and immortal . Atmospheric and perceptible music by Franz Waxman and sensational visual style by the cameraman George Barnes . The picture won Academy Awards for Best film and cinematography . The movie was brilliantly directed by the Master of Suspense . It&apos;s remade in inferior versions for Television, the 1980 adaptation with Jeremy Brett as Maxim and 1996 rendition with Charles Dance and Emilie Fox .

Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that I&apos;m laughing doesn&apos;t dilute the emotional charge.\\n\\nOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. Why not marry the two things? That&apos;s what he did in some of his early short films, and that&apos;s what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn&apos;t know if she&apos;ll ever find out what became of him.\\n\\nJackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin&apos;s genius? Coogan doesn&apos;t steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy&apos;s talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like &quot;My Boy&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist.&quot;\\n\\nChaplin&apos;s storytelling—even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene—they&apos;re perfect. Chaplin&apos;s celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.\\n\\nWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know, I can&apos;t even complain about that. It&apos;s too sweetly naïve. And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.\\n\\nOne important note: children love this movie. Show it to them while they&apos;re young, and you&apos;ll make Chaplin fans of them. And that&apos;s better than their becoming fans of almost anything that&apos;s being peddled to them.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 126532, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family'], 'datePublished': '1924-08-22', 'keywords': 'orphan,the little tramp character,baby,boy,1910s', 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000122/', 'name': 'Charles Chaplin'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0701012/', 'name': 'Edna Purviance'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001067/', 'name': 'Jackie Coogan'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000122/', 'name': 'Charles Chaplin'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0028083/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000122/', 'name': 'Charles Chaplin'}], 'duration': 'PT1H8M'}\n",

Beginning and ending with Walter Huston&apos;s award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter&apos;s portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.\\n\\nWhen, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood&apos;s most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting.

I must be honest and say I don&apos;t know what the whole point of this film was or if it was just trying to show evilness in the world but this 158-minute film kept my interest throughout. I think the film drags somewhat right before the final act but outside of that this is a very good epic that certainly has the look and feel of epics from decades ago. The visual style of the film is the most impressive thing as Anderson&apos;s camera takes us on quite a journey and also shows off some amazing locations. Another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back in the day and all the small details on the screen make for a very impressive history lesson. I also loved the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, which are done without dialogue. We see Day-Lewis&apos; rise and how he got started within these opening scenes and even though there isn&apos;t a line of dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need to know about him. A lot has been said about the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and while it is a great one I wouldn&apos;t call it the best of his career. I think he played this same type of character in Martin Scorsese&apos;s Gangs of New York and I think he was a lot better there but that&apos;s certainly not a slam against his performance here because he&apos;s great here as well. That snake quality the actor brings to this role is quite memorable and even when he&apos;s doing something good or worthwhile, you can still see that evilness in his eyes. The supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind Day-Lewis and I think this hurt in several scenes including the ones with the preacher (Paul Dano). Dano is pretty good in the role but the part needed someone a lot stronger who could match wits with Day-Lewis.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 583376, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama'], 'datePublished': '2008-02-28', 'keywords': 'oil,misanthrope,loss of hearing,prospector,money', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'There Will Be Blood', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1341980953', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1341980953/', 'description': 'Home Video Trailer from Miramax', 'duration': 'PT2M14S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T17:23:41Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000358/', 'name': 'Daniel Day-Lewis'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0200452/', 'name': 'Paul Dano'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001354/', 'name': 'Ciarán Hinds'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000759/', 'name': 'Paul Thomas Anderson'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0179341/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0022594/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0027686/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000759/', 'name': 'Paul Thomas Anderson'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0801737/', 'name': 'Upton Sinclair'}], 'duration': 'PT2H38M'}\n",

It shows an evocative post war Rome , ruined and with depressed economy , ba great deal of working class men , unemployed people looking for work and a destroyed city , too. Here De Sica reveals unsuspected depths , and an extraordinary sensitive with actors , especially the little boy . Two main actors are frankly well , Lamberto Maggiorani as the ill-fated father and Enzo Staiola as the agreeable son with sweet laughter. Both of whom are pretty good , though all players are amateurs , as filmmaker De Sica and screenwriter Zavattini decided not to use professional actors . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Vittorio de Sica , and including Sergio Leone as director assistant . De Sica was a famous actor and director .He turned to filmmaking in 1940 , making light comedies. His fifth movie collaborated with writer Cesare Zavattini , I Bambi ni ci guardano ,in which showed great sensitivity and nice fIl making . It was also the first movie he made with writer Zavattini with whom he would subsequently shoot &quot;Shoeshine&quot; , and Bicycle thief .After the boxoffice disaster &quot;Umberto D&quot; , he abandoned the Neorrealist genre to make more commercial films than previous . Subsequently , he he made &quot;Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow&quot; with Marcelo Mastroiani and Sofia Loren in which he won another Oscar .

Starring Clint Eastwood as a bounty hunter looking for a number of wanted suspects, who later partners with another bounty hunter looking for the same guys &amp; make a deal of splitting the reward but in the end when it comes down to final showdown, one of them shows their real motive behind the hunt.\\n\\nFeaturing an improved direction from Sergio Leone, For A Few Dollars More presents the director in more control of his artistry &amp; has a much stronger script to muster ahead with. The scope of camera-work, the precision of editing &amp; overall production design also get their upgrades plus the performances from the recurring cast turn out to be better than the previous film with Clint Eastwood &amp; new addition of Lee Van Cleef impressing the most.\\n\\nOn an overall scale, For A Few Dollars More is another huge step towards placing the coffin on traditional westerns &amp; presents a significant evolution of every single aspect of its making when compared with A Fistful of Dollars. Ennio Morricone&apos;s music also leaves a bigger mark than before &amp; it&apos;s exciting to observe how seamlessly it accompanies the drama.

It is truly amazing in that aspect. The cinematography and stunts are groundbreaking and exceptional with tons of impressive sequences. I&apos;ve heard that the producers utilized very little amounts of CGI; director George Miller has claimed that 90% of the movie&apos;s special effects were practical, not computer-generated. This genuinely amazed me when I was watching the movie. In general, the film delivers visually as well. It looks absolutely stunning at times with an impressive usage of colors and visual effects that look incredible. For example, there is a dust storm in which we see some shots that look truly spectacular. Mad Max: Fury Road is not only exciting to watch, but it is also beautiful.\\n\\nThe problem with this movie is that we get little to no breaks from the action. The plot is pretty shallow and not that unique. I&apos;ve seen plenty of other movies in similar settings, but with better plots. Some pauses to engage more with the characters or to explore the world would&apos;ve served the movie well.\\n\\nWhile some movies may have similar settings and better plots, very few have action of the same caliber as Mad Max: Fury Road.

The story itself is pure comedy gold; the unhappy jazz-musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are witness to the St. Valentine massacre in 1929 and flees from Chicago with an all-girl-band who&apos;s headed for Miami, dressed up as &quot;Josephine&quot; and &quot;Daphne&quot;. Soon both are hooked on Sugar Kane (Marylin Monroe), the band&apos;s lead singer - but things gets more complicated when arrived in Miami, Daphne attracts a elderly playboy and the gangster of Chicago arrives at the Floria-hotel to have a mafia-meeting.\\n\\nThe work of the three participants in center is truly great; Marylin Monroe is at her most sexy and charming, Tony Curtis&apos; brilliant control and Jack Lemmon is truly priceless at his peak. The movie paces fantastically throughout opening scenes of Chicago, onto the train-ride (features fantastically funny moments of brilliant comedy timing) and arriving at the hotel in Florida, and the situations that occurs with the band, with playboy Osgood Fielding III, Marylin Monroe and the mafia. And Billy Wilder shows his talent with keeping such a sparkling screenplay brilliantly paced and edited, never rushing itself - and Wilder sneaks in some fine moments of noir with the Chicago-gangsters brutality and cruelness. And the movie is a altogether different experience as a comedy than anything before it, the absurdity and quirkiness of Curtis and Lemmon in a transvestite-comedy is fantastically funny, and the final dialog between Osgood Fielding and Daphne/Jerry seemingly came out of the blue, and surprised me just as much today as it did back in 1959.

Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It&apos;s basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you&apos;ve ever seen. \\n\\nThe premise: in chaotic 16th century Japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. Yet Kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. To its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, Seven Samurai never falters or bores. And if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. It is said that Kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. This unusual technique gave Seven Samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history.\\n\\nThe samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. \\n\\nThe story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).\\n\\nIn the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 344714, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.6}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1954-04-26', 'keywords': 'samurai,16th century,battle,japan,old woman', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2923348761', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0ZjczYTctNDUwYi00MmM5LWE4YjAtODI5NWRiMzFhNjFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0ZjczYTctNDUwYi00MmM5LWE4YjAtODI5NWRiMzFhNjFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2923348761/', 'description': 'A poor village under attack by bandits recruits seven unemployed samurai to help them defend themselves.', 'duration': 'PT3M59S', 'uploadDate': '2022-01-08T00:20:48.403Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001536/', 'name': 'Toshirô Mifune'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0793766/', 'name': 'Takashi Shimura'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0875477/', 'name': 'Keiko Tsushima'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000041/', 'name': 'Akira Kurosawa'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0002219/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000041/', 'name': 'Akira Kurosawa'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0368074/', 'name': 'Shinobu Hashimoto'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0644823/', 'name': 'Hideo Oguni'}], 'duration': 'PT3H27M'}\n",

It&apos;s dark, it&apos;s mean, and it&apos;s one tough movie. It&apos;s not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.\\n\\nIf there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we&apos;ve got Cameron&apos;s real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.\\n\\nYeah, he&apos;s &quot;back.&quot; Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it&apos;s 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah&apos;s 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn&apos;t match with his age in the third. We&apos;ll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)\\n\\nAnother model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold&apos;s appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won&apos;t be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)\\n\\nWhew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn&apos;t as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it&apos;s got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn&apos;t in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor&apos;s resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.\\n\\nSarah doesn&apos;t trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and &quot;Xtreme&quot; edition DVDs, Sarah says, &quot;You don&apos;t know what it&apos;s like to try and kill one of these things!&quot; It&apos;s an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine&apos;s central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It&apos;s important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn&apos;t trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don&apos;t like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), &quot;T2&quot; clearly has an underlying message: One, don&apos;t judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can&apos;t everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.\\n\\nI suppose the question on most interested viewers&apos; minds is this: Is &quot;T2: Judgment Day&quot; better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.\\n\\nIn some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I&apos;d choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t have to choose.\\n\\n5/5 stars.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1090624, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.6}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Action', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '1991-08-16', 'keywords': 'time travel,future,artificial intelligence,mother son relationship,sequel', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Re-release Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2748889369', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0OTJlNTQtMzYyZi00MTBkLWEyMzItNWQwYWFhOWU1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0OTJlNTQtMzYyZi00MTBkLWEyMzItNWQwYWFhOWU1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2748889369/', 'description': 'A cyborg, identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor, must now protect her ten year old son, John Connor, from a more advanced cyborg.', 'duration': 'PT1M34S', 'uploadDate': '2017-07-01T00:24:31Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000216/', 'name': 'Arnold Schwarzenegger'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000157/', 'name': 'Linda Hamilton'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000411/', 'name': 'Edward Furlong'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000116/', 'name': 'James Cameron'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0094459/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0092551/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0038663/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000116/', 'name': 'James Cameron'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0936537/', 'name': 'William Wisher'}], 'duration': 'PT2H17M'}\n",

This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood&apos;s long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.\\n\\nYou know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can&apos;t bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood&apos;s direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.\\n\\nFollowing the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt&apos;s less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to &apos;keep an eye on him&apos;, but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family&apos;s youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt&apos;s prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.\\n\\nAll of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt&apos;s life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.\\n\\nWith a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 772934, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama'], 'datePublished': '2009-04-16', 'keywords': 'widower,gang,teenager,street gang,gang rape', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Gran Torino music video', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi517604121', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTE5MjQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc5ODIyMzE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTE5MjQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc5ODIyMzE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi517604121/', 'description': 'A music video for the song &quot;Gran Torino&quot; by Jamie Cullum, from the Gran Torino motion picture soundtrack.', 'duration': 'PT4M31S', 'uploadDate': '2009-01-06T17:01:46Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000142/', 'name': 'Clint Eastwood'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm3057402/', 'name': 'Bee Vang'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1542291/', 'name': 'Christopher Carley'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000142/', 'name': 'Clint Eastwood'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0255998/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0112616/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0062831/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1010405/', 'name': 'Nick Schenk'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm3164738/', 'name': 'Dave Johannson'}], 'duration': 'PT1H56M'}\n",

The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.\\n\\nThe story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri&apos;s seven deadly sins from &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, sets out to, &quot;preach&quot; about man&apos;s impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film&apos;s conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en&apos;s surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en&apos;s poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.\\n\\nDirected brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90&apos;s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.\\n\\nScore 10/10', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1633789, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.6}, 'contentRating': '18', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery'], 'datePublished': '1996-11-07', 'keywords': 'serial killer,detective,serial murder,seven deadly sins,murder investigation', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2508831257', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxNmJiYzctNGRkZC00YzcxLTgyNjMtMmIxZWVlNDA4ZWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxNmJiYzctNGRkZC00YzcxLTgyNjMtMmIxZWVlNDA4ZWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2508831257/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT2M17S', 'uploadDate': '2018-10-29T19:58:54.841Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000151/', 'name': 'Morgan Freeman'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000093/', 'name': 'Brad Pitt'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000228/', 'name': 'Kevin Spacey'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000399/', 'name': 'David Fincher'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0078943/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0043545/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0046718/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001825/', 'name': 'Andrew Kevin Walker'}], 'duration': 'PT2H7M'}\n",

He follows him and ultimately photographs him with another woman. Somehow these pictures end up in the papers and he is approached by another woman who it turns out is the real wife of Mulwray... and she intends to sue. He continues to investigate Mulwray and suspects some odd goings on at Water and Power... then Mulwray turns up dead; drowned during a severe drought. His continued investigation brings him closer to the real Evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns the truth about Water and Power&apos;s activities which could make some people very rich at the expense of other, poorer, people.\\n\\nThis film may have been made about a quarter of a century after the classic era for film noir but it perfectly captures the feel of those films. It has morally ambiguous characters inhabiting a murky world that contrasts with the bright Los Angeles sunshine. The story has many twists and turns without feeling unnecessarily complex or confusing. The cast does a great job; especially Jack Nicholson who is in every scene so that the viewer doesn&apos;t know anything Gettes doesn&apos;t know. Faye Dunaway is solid as Evelyn Mulwray and John Huston is suitably menacing as her father; a man standing to make a lot of money with many dark secrets.

I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: &quot;What we have here is failure to communicate.&quot; No question that&apos;s a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.\\n\\nBased on the novel by Donn Pearce, who spent two years on a chain-gang, this is the story of Luke (Paul Newman) who just can&apos;t bring himself to conform to the rules, regardless whether those be the rules of the military, society, prison, or those self-imposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later, in a throw away line, we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It&apos;s the clear indication that while he doesn&apos;t always want to fit in, Luke clearly knows right from wrong.\\n\\nThere are so many terrific scenes in this film, that it&apos;s not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden, played by Strother Martin, is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening, especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals, we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes, the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy). Watching the early cat and mouse game, and the subsequent transfer of power, feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.\\n\\nGeorge Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman, this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\\n\\nWatching Luke win over all the convicts, including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning, yet gut-wrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.\\n\\nThe supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for: Ralph Waite (4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV&apos;s The Waltons); Joe Don Baker(Buford Pusser from Walking Tall); James Gammon (later the crusty manager in Major League); and Anthony Zerbe, another iconic character actor of the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s. Also featured are Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton (singing a few songs), Wayne Rogers (from MASH), Richard Davalos (James Dean&apos;s brother Aron in East of Eden), and Rance Howard (Ron&apos;s dad as the sheriff). In a brief, but truly great scene, Jo Van Fleet (also from East of Eden), appears as Arletta, and we quickly understand Luke&apos;s background.\\n\\nOften overlooked by film historians, &quot;Lucille&quot; putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car, is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows, the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.\\n\\nThe score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman&apos;s Butch Cassidy co-star Robert Redford, the film was a decent prison drama, but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way, was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 177393, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1968-10-10', 'keywords': 'prison,fugitive,escape,bet,hard boiled egg', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Cool Hand Luke', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3936093721', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI1N2MwOTQtNmYyMC00ZDQ0LThjMWYtOTE4ZTI4YzZmZTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI1N2MwOTQtNmYyMC00ZDQ0LThjMWYtOTE4ZTI4YzZmZTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3936093721/', 'description': 'Trailer for this classic starring Paul Newman', 'duration': 'PT2M48S', 'uploadDate': '2010-07-11T03:08:56Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000056/', 'name': 'Paul Newman'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001421/', 'name': 'George Kennedy'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001510/', 'name': 'Strother Martin'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0742341/', 'name': 'Stuart Rosenberg'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0066779/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0668914/', 'name': 'Donn Pearce'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0682757/', 'name': 'Frank Pierson'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0237543/', 'name': 'Hal Dresner'}], 'duration': 'PT2H7M'}\n",

If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling. \\n\\nThe story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude&apos;s rug - and this kind of aggression just won&apos;t stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).\\n\\nWith Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it&apos;s not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro, J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I&apos;ve ever seen.

In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,&apos; director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.  \\n\\n\\tAs an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short. Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it&apos;s the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it&apos;s an obligation, and failure is not an option. If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code. Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito&apos;s demands.\\n\\n\\tMeanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he&apos;s home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he&apos;ll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks. But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to `loan&apos; Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission. So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.  \\n\\n\\tFrom the beginning of the film to it&apos;s spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.\\n\\n\\tAlec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.  It&apos;s a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden&apos;s work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.\\n\\n\\tOther notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.\\n\\n\\tThe supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green). Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, `The Bridge On the River Kwai&apos; is one of David Lean&apos;s masterpieces.  It&apos;s an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.

It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev&apos;s reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director&apos;s cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.\\n\\nFortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind&apos;s stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.\\n\\nThe ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia&apos;s greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky&apos;s imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.\\n\\nThe movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia&apos;s unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev&apos;s own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.\\n\\nIt is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don&apos;t know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.\\n\\nIt is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce&apos;s Finnegan&apos;s Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky&apos;s own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.\\n\\nTarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 53810, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '14', 'genre': ['Biography', 'Drama', 'History'], 'datePublished': '1973-04-05', 'keywords': 'painter,religious art,slow cinema,genius,silence', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2806824473', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkyNTE5ODctZTYyMy00MmQzLThiNmYtNzQxZTBiODI4N2Y2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkyNTE5ODctZTYyMy00MmQzLThiNmYtNzQxZTBiODI4N2Y2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2806824473/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT1M39S', 'uploadDate': '2020-08-28T17:38:59.115Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0813463/', 'name': 'Anatoliy Solonitsyn'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0487553/', 'name': 'Ivan Lapikov'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0342458/', 'name': 'Nikolay Grinko'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001789/', 'name': 'Andrei Tarkovsky'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0917448/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0501778/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0464846/', 'name': 'Andrey Konchalovskiy'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001789/', 'name': 'Andrei Tarkovsky'}], 'duration': 'PT3H25M'}\n",

Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.\\n\\nNot that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out, has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother&apos;s rape. Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother&apos;s mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.\\n\\nThere is never any doubt of his mother&apos;s love though the obvious strain of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious. To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180 degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn&apos;t want to hear anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees. Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb.\\n\\nHe lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also contribute to the film&apos;s second half but it is always Larson and Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn the key.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 418948, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '2016-01-28', 'keywords': 'escape,kidnapping,mother son relationship,unlawful confinement,locked in a room', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Room', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi321566745', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmY4YTFlZjktNWM0Yi00NmQ1LTg5MjQtNWQzNmRjYjdjMWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmY4YTFlZjktNWM0Yi00NmQ1LTg5MjQtNWQzNmRjYjdjMWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi321566745/', 'description': 'Trailer for Room', 'duration': 'PT1M30S', 'uploadDate': '2018-03-10T17:16:33Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0488953/', 'name': 'Brie Larson'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm5016878/', 'name': 'Jacob Tremblay'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0108703/', 'name': 'Sean Bridgers'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1049433/', 'name': 'Lenny Abrahamson'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0214624/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0018776/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0476818/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1480980/', 'name': 'Emma Donoghue'}], 'duration': 'PT1H58M'}\n",

GOW is a superb film which needs to be watched by anyone and everyone who has the slightest of respect and love for films and filmmaking.\\n\\nSneha Khawalker&apos;s rockingtingly superb music brings a whole new level of excitement in the film and Rajeev Ravi&apos;s cinematography is very very efficient, sprinkled with quite a few shots of sheer brilliance.\\n\\nAll this make a nice, superbly tasty biryani and the credit can only go the masterchef Mr.Anurag Kashyap.\\n\\n8/10, and I&apos;d defo recommend all my friends to go and watch this film in CINEMAS!', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 96201, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': 'Not Rated', 'genre': ['Action', 'Comedy', 'Crime'], 'datePublished': '2012-06-22', 'keywords': 'revenge,blood,gun,abuse,gangster', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer [OV]', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1754775321', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYxZTFkOWEtZGJiMy00MDcwLTk0OWMtYmUzNGFjNmMxMTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYxZTFkOWEtZGJiMy00MDcwLTk0OWMtYmUzNGFjNmMxMTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1754775321/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT2M38S', 'uploadDate': '2019-09-20T10:36:09.084Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0048075/', 'name': 'Manoj Bajpayee'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm14022766/', 'name': 'Ashish Chhipa'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm3190246/', 'name': 'Richa Chadha'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0440604/', 'name': 'Anurag Kashyap'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0376813/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0387932/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0356297/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm4556524/', 'name': 'Akhilesh Jaiswal'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0440604/', 'name': 'Anurag Kashyap'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm4556473/', 'name': 'Sachin K.

Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men&apos;s  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they&apos;ll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan&apos;s long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it&apos;s like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it&apos;s done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other&apos;s ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how &quot;magic&quot; actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician&apos;s use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale&apos;s Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters&apos; theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It&apos;s always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it&apos;s more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire&apos;s Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician&apos;s assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie&apos;s appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they&apos;re in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it&apos;s just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don&apos;t feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan &apos;s films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there&apos;s one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It&apos;s smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan&apos;s  movies?', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1321894, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.5}, 'contentRating': 'PG-13', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '2007-01-04', 'keywords': 'illusion,magician,rivalry,magic,death by drowning', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2885334553', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDIwYWJlODQtNTRkNy00YWZjLWI0M2ItMzU5MmVhNzY3OGJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDIwYWJlODQtNTRkNy00YWZjLWI0M2ItMzU5MmVhNzY3OGJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2885334553/', 'description': 'Two stage magicians engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion.', 'duration': 'PT2M35S', 'uploadDate': '2016-10-27T01:19:48Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000288/', 'name': 'Christian Bale'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0413168/', 'name': 'Hugh Jackman'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0424060/', 'name': 'Scarlett Johansson'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0634240/', 'name': 'Christopher Nolan'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0049348/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0225259/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0129644/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0634300/', 'name': 'Jonathan Nolan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0634240/', 'name': 'Christopher Nolan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1793993/', 'name': 'Christopher Priest'}], 'duration': 'PT2H10M'}\n",

I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the &apos;68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s. \\n\\nFor the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn&apos;t he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in &quot;The Boys of Company C,&quot; an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you&apos;re facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.\\n\\nKubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle&apos;s ending, it&apos;s almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.\\n\\nI&apos;ve read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!\\n\\nA final note: It&apos;s interesting to compare &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb&apos;s &quot;The DI,&quot; made around &apos;55 or &apos;56.

Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.', 'reviewBody': 'Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it&apos;s a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it&apos;s a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it&apos;s the best film I&apos;ve seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. \\n\\nMiles Teller, who&apos;s been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who&apos;s pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we&apos;ve never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They&apos;re urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he&apos;s looking for and when someone&apos;s wrong even if you don&apos;t know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He&apos;s a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it&apos;s not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he&apos;s known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. \\n\\nEven though he&apos;s an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he&apos;s still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey&apos;s drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it&apos;s a crime or an &apos;ends justifying the means&apos; factor of life. It&apos;s not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we&apos;re not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew&apos;s psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That&apos;s why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it&apos;s so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller&apos;s performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. \\n\\nChazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It&apos;s the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew&apos;s head however. It&apos;s a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it&apos;s merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn&apos;t be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it&apos;s cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he&apos;ll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he&apos;s pushed further and further. \\n\\nThe technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It&apos;s thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There&apos;s a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it&apos;s so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it&apos;ll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn&apos;t just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I&apos;ll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.\\n\\n10/10. Best film of the decade.\\n\\nRead more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 846115, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.5}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Music'], 'datePublished': '2015-02-05', 'keywords': 'emotional abuse,drummer,music school,teacher student relationship,new york city', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer #2', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi4006456345', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNzAzMjY0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE4NTgyMjE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNzAzMjY0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE4NTgyMjE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi4006456345/', 'description': 'Andrew Neyman is an ambitious young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory.

It&apos;s interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture - Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place - what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can&apos;t help but see the difference.\\n\\nThe murderer, artfully played by Peter Lorre, has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months. The police, despite all of their efforts, are unable to catch him, mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims. At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing. Then, the film shifts to two normally opposed groups - the police and the underworld. After several months of no results by the authorities, the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them, and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killer.\\n\\nIn a particularly well-done part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld. They discuss how they are going to catch the killer. The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released. The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group - the beggars - to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer. Both groups focus on the right suspect, the question is - who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics - the death penalty, a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion, and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 157923, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '1931-08-31', 'keywords': 'serial killer,paranoia,loss of daughter,whistling,manhunt', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi605863449', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzYjRhZGYtYmJiYi00Njg1LWJmOTctOGM0OTcyNTZmOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzYjRhZGYtYmJiYi00Njg1LWJmOTctOGM0OTcyNTZmOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi605863449/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT2M32S', 'uploadDate': '2020-07-01T15:11:23.819Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000048/', 'name': 'Peter Lorre'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0927145/', 'name': 'Ellen Widmann'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0484737/', 'name': 'Inge Landgut'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000485/', 'name': 'Fritz Lang'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0036089/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0902376/', 'name': 'Thea von Harbou'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000485/', 'name': 'Fritz Lang'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0414825/', 'name': 'Egon Jacobsohn'}], 'duration': 'PT1H57M'}\n",

This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone&apos;s own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, &apos;Raging Bull&apos;, and &apos;Rocky&apos; will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it&apos;s quite an achievement.\\n\\nThe story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).\\n\\n&apos;Rocky&apos; is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like &apos;Over the Top&apos;, &apos;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&apos; and &apos;Judge Dredd&apos;, and from the other &apos;Rocky&apos;-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone&apos;s screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, &apos;Raging Bull&apos; stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.\\n\\nI do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title.

Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet&apos;s masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.\\n\\nAs suggested in the title, the film deals with the Arthurian stories, freely reinterpreted by the Python ensemble: after recruiting his knights, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), King Arthur (Graham Chapman) embarks on a mission from God (also Chapman, voice only though): to seek and find the Holy Grail. No need to say, the journey is going to be perilous, but also hilarious, our heroes doing their &quot;best&quot; to screw everything up.\\n\\nAs in Life of Brian, there are so many good bits choosing just one or two feels reductive and disrespectful, given the material. It&apos;s pure comedy gold from start to finish, a non-stop gag marathon: from the mock Scandinavian subtitles in the opening credits to the argument about swallows, from the Killer Rabbit to the Black Knight and the jaw-dropping epilogue, you will keep grinning like never before (if you&apos;re unfamiliar with these comedians, that is). Actually, after some serious thinking I can select two particular sequences as particularly memorable: the Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot; and the Bridge of Death. The rest of the film is ace too, but those two scenes are the ones I can&apos;t stop thinking of fondly whenever the movie is mentioned.\\n\\nOh, and let&apos;s not forget Terry Gilliam&apos;s vital contribution: he doesn&apos;t appear that much as an actor (his Bridgekeeper is absolute genius, though), but he compensates that with the remarkable animations used to depict part of this epic adventure.

I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.\\n\\nThis picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very &quot;virtual&quot;, for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life &quot;grit.&quot; The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.\\n\\nThe best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.\\n\\nWALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it&apos;s previous features.

It&apos;s essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s essentially just a greatest hits package.\\n\\nVery few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero&apos;s mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says &quot;you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?&quot;.\\n\\nOf course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it&apos;s 136 mins long.\\n\\nErnest Lehman&apos;s script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. &quot;Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor&apos;s Studio&quot;. Cary Grant is so smooth one almost forgets he&apos;s over 50, and of course there&apos;s also Bernard Herrmann&apos;s vibrant score.\\n\\nEndlessly enjoyable even with repeated viewings.

Written into most scenes are strong themes about family and friendship. What it means to be a parent. Surrogate parents and families. Estranged children searching for parental figures and family.\\n\\nOf course it&apos;s all done with a great sense of humour, as characters like Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Groot light up the screen with strong verbal and visual comedy.\\n\\nQuill doesn&apos;t massively develop as a character, but we do learn more about his origins and powers. Alongside this the Guardians are portrayed as developing a family dynamic. This is great idea given they are all depicted as coming from traumatic beginnings.\\n\\nEgo is an interesting character and fantastic visualisation of an outlandish graphic-novel concept. It is not particularly subtle, but the character epitomises an extreme version of the in-built selfish drives present in everyone. Kurt Russell is on great form.\\n\\nThe contrasting father figure of Yondu is written particularly well. He has been portrayed as having egotistical characteristics too, but here is given a huge redemption arc with with moments of great altruism. It is great to see Michael Rooker playing this type of character. He is as stereotypically violent and generally aggressive as in his previous roles, but for once he gets to show some heart.\\n\\nNebula and Gamora have solid moments of relationship development. These scenes all tie in well to the movie&apos;s main themes and are important to the overarching narrative of the MCU, particularly when watching The Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Karen Gillan and Zoe Zaldana both give strong performances, especially Gillan who is a consistently strong performer in the MCU.\\n\\nVisually it is a colourful feast for the eyes and full of exciting spectacle as you would expect from a space adventure.

He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.

And you know it&apos;s a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.\\n\\nThere was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I&apos;m actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it&apos;s nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.\\n\\nSo, Jake of B99 was right.

What really pulled me in right from the start is what we&apos;ve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it&apos;s a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it&apos;s just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there&apos;s the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of &quot;chapters&quot; – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it&apos;s just a pure joy to watch.\\n\\nIf you&apos;re a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even &quot;stealing&quot; from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino&apos;s masterpiece today, it&apos;s impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it&apos;s got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it&apos;s such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time.

It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That&apos;s it, that&apos;s the movie. It could&apos;ve been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is.

However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948&apos;s &quot;Rope,&quot; though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.\\n\\nBut the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it&apos;s so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.\\n\\nAnd that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: &quot;Goodbye, my dear.&quot; The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland&apos;s plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock&apos;s camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It&apos;s Mr. Hitchcock&apos;s gift at work.\\n\\nDimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks&apos; cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 175873, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': 'PG', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '1954-05-29', 'keywords': 'blackmail,tennis,murder,tennis player,love letter', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Dial M For Murder', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3634430233', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTU3NDc3NDUtNDhkOS00ZGMyLTg3MTktYzE4MGVhNWVkMDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTU3NDc3NDUtNDhkOS00ZGMyLTg3MTktYzE4MGVhNWVkMDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3634430233/', 'description': 'Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.\\n\\nWhat makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill&apos;s interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. \\n\\nTechnically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. \\n\\nEditing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky&apos;s photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. \\n\\nILM&apos;s visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. \\n\\nAgain, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt&apos;s sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.\\n\\nHowever, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. \\n\\nCongratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1281686, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.7}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy'], 'datePublished': '1982-01-28', 'keywords': 'famous twist,part of trilogy,the force,duel,rescue', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi221753881', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQzN2E0YmYtYzgxNS00NWM4LWFkY2ItZjBiNzgyZTM3ZmFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQzN2E0YmYtYzgxNS00NWM4LWFkY2ItZjBiNzgyZTM3ZmFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi221753881/', 'description': 'After the rebels have been brutally overpowered by the Empire on their newly established base, Luke Skywalker takes advanced Jedi training with Master Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader as part of his plan to capture Luke.', 'duration': 'PT2M7S', 'uploadDate': '2015-12-11T15:12:16Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000434/', 'name': 'Mark Hamill'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000148/', 'name': 'Harrison Ford'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000402/', 'name': 'Carrie Fisher'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0449984/', 'name': 'Irvin Kershner'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0071326/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0102824/', 'name': 'Leigh Brackett'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001410/', 'name': 'Lawrence Kasdan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000184/', 'name': 'George Lucas'}], 'duration': 'PT2H4M'}\n",

His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson&apos;s film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. \\n\\nThrough complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave&apos;s company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he&apos;s blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.\\n\\nI frankly don&apos;t understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren&apos;t familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. \\n\\nWes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities.

With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn&apos;t go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.\\n\\n&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesn&apos;t recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel&apos;s distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.\\n\\nIf anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.\\n\\nKaufman&apos;s story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman&apos;s trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;. Gondry&apos;s diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.\\n\\nThe sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.\\n\\nThis is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it.

Deliberately slow-moving at points, yet undeniably exciting in and out of it&apos;s action sequences, and a fantastic introduction to anime itself.\\n\\nWithout revealing too much of the plot, it takes us through the life of Nausicaa, a princess of a small village, and her struggles to stop warring nations from destroying an important source that can save the planet. The planet has already gone through a major destruction that nearly wiped out humanity, and their are large insects called ohmu, that guard the source that is spreading through the world.\\n\\nMiyazaki introduces an empowerment of female characters in his animes, such as Princess Mononoke, Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service, and his most recent, Howl&apos;s Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro). The characters are done with style and care, and, in Nausicaa, there is no exception.\\n\\nIt amazes me that this film created some controversy when released, being banned in Poland because of it&apos;s depiction of an ecological disaster. Though the movie is obviously fantasy, it turns out that some may consider it a touchy subject. I didn&apos;t find any offense whatsoever with anything the movie showed, just a futuristic disaster no doubt caused by man.\\n\\nCombining fantasy and science-fiction, Nausicaa is nice to look at. It certainly shows it&apos;s age when compared to some newer animes, not having the help from high-end computers. Considering it was done in the 80&apos;s, Miyazaki&apos;s production team did a great job. Little details, backgrounds, gadgets, &amp; animals are drawn slightly better then some Japanese animes from that time.\\n\\nKeep in mind that my review is based on the Disney release (Feb 2005). It&apos;s cleaned up, unedited, with new voices from well known actors that sound great (but I still prefer subtitles). Keep far away from the old version &apos;Warriors of the Wind&apos;, which chops off more then half-hour from the movie.\\n\\n9 out of 10', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 169289, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8}, 'genre': ['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '1987-11-19', 'keywords': 'post apocalypse,princess,giant insect,pollution,dying planet', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Miyazaki Collection Wave 2', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3336503577', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU2Yzk4ZGEtNzIwMi00NDU0LTk4NTMtYjcxOTNkOWE0N2NmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU2Yzk4ZGEtNzIwMi00NDU0LTk4NTMtYjcxOTNkOWE0N2NmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3336503577/', 'description': 'CT #7', 'duration': 'PT2M20S', 'uploadDate': '2008-08-04T03:33:58Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0793585/', 'name': 'Sumi Shimamoto'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0875332/', 'name': 'Mahito Tsujimura'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0477449/', 'name': 'Hisako Kyôda'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0594503/', 'name': 'Hayao Miyazaki'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0205112/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0016626/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0001105/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0594503/', 'name': 'Hayao Miyazaki'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1248357/', 'name': 'Cindy Davis'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1248358/', 'name': 'Donald H.

This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary &apos;Heart of Darkness&apos; made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making &apos;the Godfather&apos; and &apos;GodfatherII&apos; and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos;. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz&apos;s compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN&apos;T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos; is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. \\n\\nThis movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn&apos;t at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is &apos;Platoon&apos; in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. \\n\\nCoppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.\\n\\nIt is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.\\n\\nA little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the &apos;Redux&apos; version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a &apos;new and improved&apos; version of the movie', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 663707, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.5}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Mystery', 'War'], 'datePublished': '1980-04-24', 'keywords': 'vietnam,vietnam war,jungle,insanity,secret mission', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Apocalypse Now: Blu-ray Three-Disc Full Disclosure Edition', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3543773721', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBmNDMwNjctODIzNS00MzgxLThhYmItNjcyNzQ0ZjI3NzE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBmNDMwNjctODIzNS00MzgxLThhYmItNjcyNzQ0ZjI3NzE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3543773721/', 'description': 'Trailer for Apocalypse Now', 'duration': 'PT1M31S', 'uploadDate': '2015-12-12T07:06:23Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000640/', 'name': 'Martin Sheen'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000008/', 'name': 'Marlon Brando'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000380/', 'name': 'Robert Duvall'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000338/', 'name': 'Francis Ford Coppola'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0020958/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0035894/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0587518/', 'name': 'John Milius'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000338/', 'name': 'Francis Ford Coppola'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0380282/', 'name': 'Michael Herr'}], 'duration': 'PT2H27M'}\n",

From the word &apos;go&apos;, this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. &apos;Rang De Basanti&apos; is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career&apos;s best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What &apos;Mangal Pandey&apos; couldn&apos;t do for Aamir Khan, &apos;Rang De Basanti&apos; does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn&apos;t have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her &apos;pucca Punjaban&apos; character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called &apos;Young Guns of India&apos; based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled &apos;Rang De Basanti&apos;. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of &apos;Mangal Pandey&apos; completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that&apos;s what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours&apos; souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.\\n\\nThe Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia&apos;s fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. \\n\\nRating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 119215, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Not Rated', 'genre': ['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '2006-01-26', 'keywords': 'delhi india,murder,friend,india,awakening', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Rang De Basanti trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1133361945', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRjNjM5YzEtNzFhNi00YzA4LTlkZmMtMGZlNTI0ZWZkNTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRjNjM5YzEtNzFhNi00YzA4LTlkZmMtMGZlNTI0ZWZkNTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1133361945/', 'description': 'The story of six young Indians who assist an English Woman to film a documentary on the extremist freedom fighters from their past, and the events that lead them to relive the long forgotten saga of freedom.', 'duration': 'PT1M55S', 'uploadDate': '2018-06-14T06:45:37Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0451148/', 'name': 'Aamir Khan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1675786/', 'name': 'Soha Ali Khan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1413459/', 'name': 'Siddharth'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1018493/', 'name': 'Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0245939/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0131238/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1028832/', 'name': 'Renzil D&apos;Silva'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1149334/', 'name': 'Prasoon Joshi'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1018493/', 'name': 'Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra'}], 'duration': 'PT2H47M'}\n",

The central character is a &quot;stalker,&quot; a man who makes a living by illegally escorting people through a restricted area to The Room, a place where their greatest wish will supposedly come true. Exactly why the area is restricted is never made perfectly clear; in the novel this film is partially based on, &quot;The Roadside Picnic,&quot; it was a site where aliens briefly landed, and The Room was an object they left behind almost as if it were refuse. But Tarkovsky would rather not settle for such a flat explanation. To him, The Room is a place that means different things to the people who journey there, and the stark, ravished landscape they must journey through consists of the phobias and anxieties that they can hardly bear to face. The expedition the men experience is a long and often maddening one, and there are many scenes where the camera lingers on a beautifully composed shot so that the viewer can take time to understand how the characters fit into the settings and how those settings form both natural and supernatural obstacles.\\n\\nAndrei Tarkovsky was an artist who did not like giving solid answers to the questions his films posed. He sculpted his stories so that viewers who had the patience and self-discipline to stay attentive all the way through could draw their own conclusions. If there is any specific meaning to &quot;Stalker,&quot; it is that we have to fully understand anything for which we are willing to alter our lives.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 134132, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Not Rated', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Sci-Fi'], 'datePublished': '1980-10-23', 'keywords': 'guide,writer,professor,ruins,railway', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi370851353', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmZiMjUzN2MtZmMwZC00Mjg4LWFhMTktMjEyOWY5N2UzNWI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmZiMjUzN2MtZmMwZC00Mjg4LWFhMTktMjEyOWY5N2UzNWI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi370851353/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT2M', 'uploadDate': '2020-06-30T11:28:30.519Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0293981/', 'name': 'Alisa Freyndlikh'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0435289/', 'name': 'Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0813463/', 'name': 'Anatoliy Solonitsyn'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001789/', 'name': 'Andrei Tarkovsky'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0917448/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0533670/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0835297/', 'name': 'Arkadiy Strugatskiy'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0835298/', 'name': 'Boris Strugatskiy'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001789/', 'name': 'Andrei Tarkovsky'}], 'duration': 'PT2H42M'}\n",

In our cynical modern world, who would enjoy a pompous-looking big-budget swords-and-sandals religious epic when you have Tarantino and Appatow?\\n\\nI saw &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; for the first time in fourth grade, it was part of our history course and being an Asterix buff, I loved watching real-life legionaries, galley slavery not to mention the chariot race, the film also enlightened me on Christianity and on Judaism (when my only religious reference was monotheism number three) and scared the hell out of me with leper. It worked on a cinematic level as much as educational, I guess even in its TV-sized crappy 80&apos;s VHS look, we kids enjoyed &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; especially the rivalry between Judah (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).\\n\\nI never watched &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; after that but nor did I have any doubt over its status as a colossal masterpiece. Watching it again a few years ago and then a few days ago, I was surprised by how engraved in my memory &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was, and how the moments that stood out were still having the same effect. When Ben-Hur and Messala meet after many years, I&apos;m always anticipating that first breech in the fortress of their friendship when the young Roman tribune will have one word too many about Ben-Hur&apos;s people, taking for granted their friendship and Judah&apos;s nobility as marks of submission. The second encounter is even more thrilling because it&apos;s like watching a shaking edifice waiting to collapse.\\n\\nIt was a nice call from the director Wyler to mark the feud between the two ex-friends at the second encounter, hence putting more gravitas around their relationship, that screenwriter Gore Vidal tried to impregnate with homoerotic subtext. The story is known by movie buffs, Vidal wanted to make the interactions look as the two rivals were former lovers, the subtext works even more when you look at Stephen Boyd&apos;s &quot;enamored&quot; eyes toward Charlton Heston. But &apos;Chuck&apos; never knew the trick and was annoyed about it, I guess I prefer the way their hatred epitomize the conflict between Romans and Jews sealing as one of the most memorable rivalries in history of cinema, with the most heart-pounding climactic face-to-face (or should I say wheel-to-wheel).\\n\\nI had positive feelings about &quot;Gladiator&quot; but &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; is the masterpiece that dwarfs any contemporary masterpiece, a sweeping revenge story that doesn&apos;t rely at all on fake CGI and special effects. It took William Wyler&apos;s expertise built up in three decades of experience to make &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; equal the reference of the time that was Cecil B. De Mille&apos;s 1925 version. As a matter of fact, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; has been blockbuster material from the start, ever since Lewis Wallace&apos;s best-seller of the late century, it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story, with galley combats, a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told, with a hero going from idealism to anger, from revenge to love, all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was an instant classic Hollywood couldn&apos;t ignore.\\n\\nIf 1925 had the race and the thrills, the 1959 one had a bigger scope, bigger budget, the colors, the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50&apos;s audience that TV wasn&apos;t yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies, like &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; or &quot;Taras Boulba&quot; you would think he went there, inside the screen. And right now, I can&apos;t imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race, there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element, but as a real race, and it never, never suspends your disbelief, it&apos;s like at any new viewing, Messalah can finally win.\\n\\nThere are so many classic moments that filled the three-hour-and-half journey that you&apos;re never in a state of non-anticipation, when the new inquisitor&apos;s parade starts, you keep an eye on that loose roof tile, the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert, you wait for the &apos;greatest cameo ever made&apos;, in the galleys, the big fight and Ben-Hur rescuing Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race, the film gets a tad too long, but only because you can&apos;t just sweep off such a rich epic with a five-minute resolution, and Charlton Heston, in his greatest role, contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film, I don&apos;t think he gets the credit he deserved, he brings to his Judah Ben-Hur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.\\n\\nOther cast members include Oscar-winning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah&apos;s mentor, Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther, Martha Scott and Cathy O&apos;Donnell as Judah&apos;s mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast, editing, directing, having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins, only to be matched in 1997 with &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; and oddly enough, these titles could somewhat apply to &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. \\n\\nI haven&apos;t seen the &apos;original&apos; and I&apos;m in no hurry for the remake, but I don&apos;t get I&apos;ll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn&apos;t see it many times in my life but it&apos;s always present in my memories as if it wasn&apos;t about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let&apos;s not forget the name of the director: William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece, which is saying a lot, given his previous streaks.\\n\\n&quot;Ben-Hur&quot;: A Christ Tale, a tale of vengeance, in fact a tale of all tales...', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 239239, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'G', 'genre': ['Adventure', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1982-08-26', 'keywords': 'talking to a horse,roman empire,whip,person on fire,baldness', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Ben-Hur: 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collectors Edition [Blu-Ray]', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1269283609', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEwNjM3NDktYjEyMS00NTVmLThlMDktN2Y2ZmNkODYwZjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEwNjM3NDktYjEyMS00NTVmLThlMDktN2Y2ZmNkODYwZjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1269283609/', 'description': 'Official Trailer', 'duration': 'PT3M', 'uploadDate': '2018-05-23T17:03:18Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000032/', 'name': 'Charlton Heston'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0370144/', 'name': 'Jack Hawkins'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000963/', 'name': 'Stephen Boyd'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0943758/', 'name': 'William Wyler'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0007143/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0908753/', 'name': 'Lew Wallace'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0876562/', 'name': 'Karl Tunberg'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000683/', 'name': 'Gore Vidal'}], 'duration': 'PT3H32M'}\n",

Most of the ones I&apos;ve seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.\\n\\nLike so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since &quot;3 Idiots&quot; is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn&apos;t really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it&apos;s also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.\\n\\nAs for the plot, it&apos;s very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don&apos;t want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you&apos;ll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears.

Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.\\n\\nI do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon-Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.\\n\\nThe film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du-Man (Song Kang-Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you&apos;d call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong-Gu.\\n\\nServing as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae-Yun (Kim Sang-Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park - methodical and rational - and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.\\n\\nAs the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his &apos;keen eye&apos;, suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon-Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn&apos;t just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.\\n\\nMemories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea&apos;s A-list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time.

English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into &quot;the trap of the picturesque&quot;, but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don&apos;t have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.\\n\\nTHIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it&apos;s cut altogether - you won&apos;t catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it&apos;s about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don&apos;t.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick&apos;s musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert&apos;s name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I&apos;d been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he&apos;s responsible for: &quot;Spartacus&quot; (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) &quot;2001&quot; (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.

Buy the soundtrack and you will be rewarded with some of the most stunning music you can hear. Mozart&apos;s music excells with brilliant treatment and dies with a bad performance. And that, after all, is what the film is about. Without his music, Mozart would be lost in time, a fate that the narrator of the story, the composer Salieri, saw as his own. Ironically, while Salieri has indeed been completely overshadowed by Mozart, his music still survives and has its followers.\\n\\nBut beyond the music this is an outstanding film. Set in the prettiest and most flamboyant century of the last millennium, it is visually stunning and the writer&apos;s portrayal of jealousy is perceptive. The casting of the Austrian King and courtiers, (indeed all the actors in this film) that Mozart needed to impress capture the gentility and courtesy of the time, and also subtly shows their growing indignation and impatience at Mozart&apos;s personality and behaviour; the presentation of Mozart as punk musician is probably the only failing in the film. As a theatrical device to show that genius can come in disastrous packages it succeeds well, but anyone with any historic sense of social ettiquette or manners will know that Mozart&apos;s sill y behaviour would be well wide of the truth, as might, perhaps, be the concept of Salieri as murderer-in-chief. Only in the final scenes is Mozart&apos;s brilliance as a composer truly explored in what amounts to a deconstruction of his final composition - his moving, uncompleted and poignant Requiem mass.\\n\\nAnother unintended star in this film are the candle lit sets and theatres of the 18th Century; their operas and drama ooze a magic  that is lacking in the present world and which modern producers might well try to reintroduce; so lovely are these buildings with their flickering lights and theatrical techniques that one is left desperate to to seek out these rare theatres to experience them.\\n\\nThis film leaves one breathless from its visual beauty, its magnificent score and the choreography, indeed, of the two together. Mozart&apos;s life had the air of tragedy, and his undoubted genius speaks to us now and forever. This film is a monument to the skills of the writer, maker, performers and, of course, Mozart&apos;s music.

Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O&apos;Toole, &quot;went native&quot; when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness&apos;s Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence&apos;s efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.\\n\\nLawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence&apos;s direction, attack and disrupt the Turks&apos; efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn.\\n\\nScripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O&apos;Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. \\n\\nOne of the best films ever made.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 293155, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': 'Approved', 'genre': ['Adventure', 'Biography', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1962-12-11', 'keywords': 'desert,arabia,ottoman empire,arab,bedouin', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2095825433', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMWEwZjAtZmE2ZS00YmVkLTlmMjktMDZjMGExYjQwM2MxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRpZWdtb25n._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMWEwZjAtZmE2ZS00YmVkLTlmMjktMDZjMGExYjQwM2MxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRpZWdtb25n._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2095825433/', 'description': 'The story of T.E.

It wasn&apos;t until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadn&apos;t.\\n\\nThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony, It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress (Colbert) who marries a shallow, yet dashing aviator.  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation.  Instead, she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York, where her husband awaits.  The film quickly turns into an `on the road&apos; flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable, a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story.  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventure.\\n\\nI&apos;m a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy.  Of course, there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone (the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich) but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles.  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies, with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre, Bringing up Baby, as a five.\\n\\n Whatever its classification, It Happened One Night is a charming film that backs up its merit as a multiple Oscar winner.  It is one of those films that may not be completely profound or deep, but is important nonetheless if anything, for its place in film history.\\n\\n--Shelly', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 104116, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Comedy', 'Romance'], 'datePublished': '1935-01-10', 'keywords': 'bus,reporter,spoiled brat,haystack,journalism', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'It Happened One Night -- Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3410886681', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTEzMjI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTEzMjI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3410886681/', 'description': 'A spoiled heiress, running away from her family, is helped by a man who&apos;s actually a reporter looking for a story.

Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition (especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis), but these characters are so well developed and played like human-beings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.\\n\\nI love the flow and pacing of the Director&apos;s Cut; it takes its time, and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula &quot;first major plot point at minute 12&quot; cookie-cutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I&apos;m interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.\\n\\nThe underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.\\n\\nAnd despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it&apos;s a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.\\n\\nJurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I&apos;ve ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he&apos;s forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.\\n\\nThe rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film&apos;s characters and their portrayals. It&apos;s both disappointing and satisfying that I&apos;m not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I&apos;ve reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these &quot;heroes&quot;, the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.\\n\\nAnother aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these &quot;talked about&quot; scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.\\n\\nI can go on for a long while: Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film&apos;s lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I&apos;ll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 250816, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.4}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'War'], 'datePublished': '1990-06-07', 'keywords': 'submarine movie,submarine,ship&apos;s log,german navy,war at sea', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Das Boot', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi4153458201', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA2MDNhMTItNjhlNi00NzM4LTk5NTktODM2MTI1M2VmOGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA2MDNhMTItNjhlNi00NzM4LTk5NTktODM2MTI1M2VmOGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi4153458201/', 'description': 'Official Trailer', 'duration': 'PT1M6S', 'uploadDate': '2020-03-17T17:03:24.177Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001638/', 'name': 'Jürgen Prochnow'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0344963/', 'name': 'Herbert Grönemeyer'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0921044/', 'name': 'Klaus Wennemann'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000583/', 'name': 'Wolfgang Petersen'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0011145/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0004917/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0100358/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000583/', 'name': 'Wolfgang Petersen'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0118164/', 'name': 'Lothar G.

Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.\\n\\nToy Story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of film-making and entertainment. The humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. This time, thanks to an incredible script, there&apos;s more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. It literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. The predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. Guys, this is the go-to movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last.\\n\\nJust like Toy Story 2&apos;s subtle and underlying themes, Toy Story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. On the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isn&apos;t all it seems. At the same time, Andy is heading for college, but Woody isn&apos;t quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. The deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. Michael Arndt, the Oscar winner that wrote Little Miss Sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. Then with the help of John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (who serves as the director), we see plenty of references to Pixar, other movies, the previous Toy Story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio (Miyazaki).\\n\\nThe writing wasn&apos;t the only thing that was on par with the first two Toy Story movies. The voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. Come on now, just read em&apos;: Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Jody Benson, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, John Ratzenburger, Ned Beatty, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton. Unlike what Dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, Pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. Because honestly, was there even a point to Angelina Jolie voicing the tiger in Kung Fu Panda? On the other hand, very few can pull an authentic Barbie like Jody Benson (a.k.a. Ariel in the Little Mermaid). It takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their A-game.\\n\\nLee Unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as Lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. The truth is, Pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. This fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in Pixar&apos;s better works like Ratatoille, Finding Nemo, and Up. They all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. But unlike all the other Pixar movies (with the exception of The Incredibles), Toy Story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of Castle in the Sky (a Miyazaki adventure masterpiece). Other reviewers have noted this before me, but this Toy Story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. With so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high.\\n\\nBottom Line: Toy Story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the best sequel since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the best movie we&apos;ve seen this year. This movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tear-jerking. And yes, just like Up&apos;s opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which Pixar will play with your heartstrings like Eric Clapton playing tears of Heaven. If you enjoyed the first two Toy Stories, there&apos;s no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the quality-filled saga. How Pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me.\\n\\nWalt Disney may not be one-hundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art Pixar has delivered ever since 1995. Pixar has re-created Walt Disney &apos;s magical methods of storytelling and movie-making, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. The direction was fantastic, the writing was Oscar-worthy, and the overall production is Best Picture caliber. This is Pixar&apos;s best work since Finding Nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. Despite my cynical nature, there&apos;s no way I can grade this any less than perfect.

Serial killer... or capitalist? This film explains there might not be much difference and perhaps shows us why serial killers in the 1980s were more celebrated than any time before or since in popular culture.\\n\\nThis is not a film for everyone. Some (like myself) will love every little aspect, while others might be turned off my the sex and violence... or just be really confused by the style (the directing is weird, but actually pretty straight-forward once you&apos;ve read the book). I suppose that is to be expected. Even those looking for a horror film might be let down, as that isn&apos;t the real focus here.\\n\\nThe cast of this film is amazing. Willem Defoe needs no introduction. Chloe Sevigny (one of my favorites), Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon (not my favorite but good for her role) and Gwen Turner. Even Samantha Mathis shows up. But, of course, stealing the show is Christian Bale.\\n\\nBale was the perfect choice to play Bateman and I&apos;m glad director Mary Harron would settle for no one else (turning down Ed Norton, who gets compared to Bale but remains inferior). Bale is able to be any character he wants (comapre this to &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;The Prestige&quot; and especially &quot;The Machinist&quot; and see if there&apos;s any of the same characters here). As Bateman, he is perfectly self-absorbed and also maniacally distant. The little dance during the Huey Lewis scene (one I have heard he added himself) remains for me one of the two key scenes (the other involving a chainsaw).\\n\\nBesides the great acting (the real reason to watch this), the music is very noteworthy. The book does a fine job of elaborating on the music of the 1980s, and I think they incorporated that well here (throwing it in to death scenes rather than as solo pieces adds an interesting twist). This film, along with the gentlemen I go to the tavern with, really got me into Huey Lewis and Phil Collins. Which is really wonderful. Not so much on the Robert Palmer or Whitney Houston...\\n\\nI guess I should also compliment them on the tasteful way (read: artistic) the sex and violence was done. Ax wounds, chainsaws and bite marks... threesomes and science-knows-what done with a coat hangar. But the vast majority is shot from such angles that it&apos;s almost all left to the imagination: you think you see more than you really do.\\n\\nClearly, I really want you to see this film. It&apos;s possibly Bale&apos;s best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show. You won&apos;t like it if you don&apos;t like horror, but the title is &quot;American Psycho&quot; and the cover has a man with a knife, so you know what you&apos;re getting yourself into.

I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\\n\\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson.

In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman&apos;s love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.\\n\\nThis is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner&apos;s Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn&apos;t been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future.

One of the best of 2003 in my view.\\n\\nThis movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.\\n\\nAt first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I&apos;ve always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.\\n\\nWhat i&apos;m saying is I couldn&apos;t get enough of this movie. It was so well done.\\n\\nJohnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.\\n\\nGeoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.\\n\\nKeira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor&apos;s daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.\\n\\nOrlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.\\n\\nThe more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You&apos;ll see what I mean when you watch it.\\n\\nThe story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner&apos;s child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.\\n\\nA great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story.

The film was indeed ahead of its time in many ways. First, the action was really good - there were some glitches here and there, but it was far more credible than what the times had set the public for. Secondly, the attention to detail, as expected from Ramesh Sippy, is first-rate. Sippy, a great director whose combination of professional, technically skilled direction, impressive storytelling, and the delicate yet honest depiction of his stories, produced several classic Hindi pictures. Sholay is a good product although sadly it mixes too many genres and is overlong for the story it tells. It could have easily edited out some parts. Given the extraordinary brutality of the villainous characters and the situations, as well as the marked contrast between the good and the evil, I think the comedic parts (except for those of Basanti) were grossly redundant, among others, as they dragged the narrative and undermined its consistency as well as the minimalist approach that was so successfully employed by Sippy in some key scenes.\\n\\nSet in a rural, remote region in southern India, the film is beautifully shot, and Sippy manages to capture the essence of the village and its people. One wonderful scene shows the routine of the village and the different activities of its inhabitants in the morning, a rare glimpse into the cultural weight of the place, which few directors would bother to tap into. This is where our heroes and villains are thrown, in an interesting story which benefits from Sippy&apos;s unique direction. The realism with which some of the situations are portrayed is striking, and it is matched by a careful handling of the proceedings in ways the Indian moviegoing public, which was used to being spoonfed by Hindi filmmakers, had not been accustomed to. Note for one the way the romance between Veeru and Radha is portrayed. Just watch the scene in which Jai is playing his harmonica as Radha is walking around and turning off the Kerosene lamps. Such subtlety is rarely seen in Hindi films. This is not to say that the film is devoid of any sentimentality. Still, the overall thing is really good - the film is both entertaining and then it is also quite moving and heartbreaking in some hard-hitting scenes, not to mention the famous, harrowing parts.\\n\\nThe film&apos;s authenticity is achieved in large parts through the acting, particularly the grounded, authentic performances of the main characters. Sholay is in my view Sanjeev Kumar&apos;s story as it is his character&apos;s determination that carries the narrative forward. He is tremendous. Dharmendra plays the energetic and happy-go-lucky Veeru pretty well, but Bachchan is fantastic in a subdued, quiet performance as Jai. Hema Malini is wonderful as the iconic, highly talkative and kind-hearted village belle Basanti; her comic timing is top-notch, and her dance numbers are never less than fabulous. Out of the two couple, it is Jaya Bhaduri of course who can always be trusted to do so much by doing so little. Her quietly understated performance is one of the film&apos;s assets, the other one being Amjad Khan&apos;s phenomenal turn as one of the greatest screen villains of Hindi cinema. Sholay is greatly aided by the great background score which enhances some of the most difficult scenes and helps alleviate others. R. D. Burman&apos;s soundtrack is as memorable as the film. Sholay is definitely a classic in many ways. It is not flawless, nor do I think it matters. In many ways it is a landmark film, and I&apos;m sure non-Indians might enjoy it just as much.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 55983, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Not Rated', 'genre': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy'], 'datePublished': '1975-08-15', 'keywords': 'bandit gang,bounty hunter,friendship between men,widow,villain', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Sholay trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi214219545', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFmMjE5YTUtZjIyYi00OWJkLWFlMzEtNjZjNzY1YTNkOTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFmMjE5YTUtZjIyYi00OWJkLWFlMzEtNjZjNzY1YTNkOTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi214219545/', 'description': 'After his family is murdered by a notorious and ruthless bandit, a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture the bandit.', 'duration': 'PT1M2S', 'uploadDate': '2018-07-19T05:08:58.715Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0474876/', 'name': 'Sanjeev Kumar'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0004429/', 'name': 'Dharmendra'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000821/', 'name': 'Amitabh Bachchan'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0802693/', 'name': 'Ramesh Sippy'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0601433/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0110893/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0015287/', 'name': 'Javed Akhtar'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0451311/', 'name': 'Salim Khan'}], 'duration': 'PT3H24M'}\n",

Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the &quot;great film&quot; line, and Casino is certainly no exception. \\n\\nCasino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  \\n\\nRobert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can&apos;t stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese&apos;s normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.\\n\\n Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I&apos;m a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn&apos;t just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  \\n\\nBeing a complete film geek, I generally don&apos;t go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I&apos;d seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, &quot;A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies&quot; which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.\\n\\n--Shelly', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 517264, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': 'R', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1996-03-07', 'keywords': 'crime epic,las vegas nevada,casino,mafia,gambling', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Casino', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1035796761', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2ZmYxZjYtMzZjYi00Y2U2LWE0MzMtZjkwMTQ1OTlkMTgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2ZmYxZjYtMzZjYi00Y2U2LWE0MzMtZjkwMTQ1OTlkMTgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1035796761/', 'description': 'Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment', 'duration': 'PT26S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T13:03:38Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000134/', 'name': 'Robert De Niro'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000232/', 'name': 'Sharon Stone'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000582/', 'name': 'Joe Pesci'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000217/', 'name': 'Martin Scorsese'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0005073/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0059966/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0015641/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0683380/', 'name': 'Nicholas Pileggi'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000217/', 'name': 'Martin Scorsese'}], 'duration': 'PT2H58M'}\n",

It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score.  &quot;The Third Man&quot; is remembered for many things - for Orson Welles&apos; wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises.  Adding to these is Joseph Cotten&apos;s fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together - it is his character who initiates most of the action, and also through whom we view everything and everyone else.\\n\\nThe story starts, after a nicely done prologue, with Martins arriving in Vienna, and finding out that his friend Harry is not only dead but is accused of running a particularly destructive black market racket.  Martins sets out at once to prove his friend&apos;s innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend - but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better.  It is just right that Martins is an innocent who writes cheap novels for a living, and he gets a pretty memorable lesson in fiction vs. reality.  There are some great scenes (the Ferris-wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins.  The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.\\n\\nThis is a fine, flawless classic, and while obviously belonging to an earlier era, it deserves a look from anyone who appreciates good movies.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 171812, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Approved', 'genre': ['Film-Noir', 'Mystery', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '1949-09-03', 'keywords': 'expatriate,faking one&apos;s death,american abroad,rubble,carousel', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'The Third Man: 4k Restoration', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi992655385', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxNTQxYzAtMWFiMC00YTFiLTlmZTgtNzBmMjhmNjg5OWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxNTQxYzAtMWFiMC00YTFiLTlmZTgtNzBmMjhmNjg5OWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi992655385/', 'description': 'Trailer for The Third Man: 4k Restoration', 'duration': 'PT1M31S', 'uploadDate': '2018-03-10T17:22:38Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000080/', 'name': 'Orson Welles'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001072/', 'name': 'Joseph Cotten'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0885098/', 'name': 'Alida Valli'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0715346/', 'name': 'Carol Reed'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0103018/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001294/', 'name': 'Graham Greene'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000080/', 'name': 'Orson Welles'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0466099/', 'name': 'Alexander Korda'}], 'duration': 'PT1H44M'}\n",

Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney&apos;s remarkable career, both story-wise and technically, the film remains an unsurpassed achievement!\\n\\nBased on P.L. Travers&apos; tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors&apos; works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney&apos;s desire to make a definitive, truly &apos;special&apos; film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed &apos;pet&apos; project, &quot;Darby O&apos;Gill and the Little People&quot;, he was more confident than ever in the story&apos;s potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to &apos;visualize&apos; 1910 London through his matte paintings.\\n\\nWith Travers&apos; grudging approval, casting began. While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent. Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot;) as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.\\n\\nBut it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly &apos;made&apos; the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in &quot;Camelot&quot; on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right &apos;Mary&apos;, and approached her for the role. &quot;But I&apos;m pregnant,&quot; she told him. &quot;No problem,&quot; he replied. &quot;I&apos;ll wait!&quot;\\n\\nAnd thus a Classic was born!\\n\\nA multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including &apos;Best Actress&apos; for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her &quot;Lady&quot; costar, Rex Harrison, who won &apos;Best Actor&apos;), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.\\n\\nWith songs both silly and sublime, seamless intermeshing of live performers and animation as only the Disney studio, at that time, was capable of, and the undeniable magnetism of Andrews and Van Dyke, it is nearly impossible NOT to like &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;!'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 172793, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 7.8}, 'contentRating': 'KN', 'genre': ['Comedy', 'Family', 'Fantasy'], 'datePublished': '1986-11-04', 'keywords': 'live action and animation,nanny,magic,live action animated hybrid,female protagonist', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Mary Poppins: 50th Anniversary Edition', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2574362649', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmOTEzZTctMmM3Yi00NDJkLWJiMDctM2Q1Zjg5YzEzMjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmOTEzZTctMmM3Yi00NDJkLWJiMDctM2Q1Zjg5YzEzMjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2574362649/', 'description': 'CT 1E', 'duration': 'PT1M36S', 'uploadDate': '2013-12-13T07:49:12Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000267/', 'name': 'Julie Andrews'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001813/', 'name': 'Dick Van Dyke'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0866835/', 'name': 'David Tomlinson'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0829038/', 'name': 'Robert Stevenson'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0098836/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0909556/', 'name': 'Bill Walsh'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0196119/', 'name': 'Don DaGradi'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0871308/', 'name': 'P.L.

The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.\\n\\nI&apos;d never heard of Miyazaki. Then I saw Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, and Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service. Wow. I think Ms Jones and Mr. Miyazaki must be kindred souls. His movies share a lot with her novels \\x96 a whimsical sense of humor, impossible to pigeonhole into a category, magic and mischief, and a firm respect for the audience&apos;s intelligence. I began to pace the floor in anticipation of the movie.\\n\\nI saw the movie today. I was not disappointed. The soul of the story is intact, Sophie and Howl and Calcifer are nearly as I imagined them. Yes, there are some plot adjustments. Think of it as the Series 12C version (for those who have read Ms Jones&apos; Chrestomanci books.) The main elements are there, some re-arranged, some changed, yet with a full understanding of the original. Much like the 2004 version of Peter Pan \\x96 much was changed, but the soul is the same.\\n\\nFor those who wonder, here are the differences between the movie and the novel. I&apos;ve tried to phrase them carefully to avoid spoilers for either fans of Ms Jones&apos;s work who have yet to see the movie, and those who have seen the movie and have yet to read the book:\\n\\n\\x95 Why the witch bespells Sophie\\n\\n\\x95 Where the door opens when the dial points to black\\n\\n\\x95Sophie&apos;s sister Martha, and the plot line involving sister Lettie are not in the movie \\x95 Mrs. Pentstemmon, Miss Angorian, Mrs. Fairfax are also missing, but elements of each are woven into other characters in the movie \\x95 Michael (Markl) is a different age \\x95 The battles \\x96 magical and military \\x96 are quite different (but equally spectacular) \\x95 The dog appears at a different time, with a different, yet just as mysterious, agenda \\x95 The scarecrow&apos;s relationship with Sophie is different \\x95 Thelevel of technology is different. (I did miss the 7-league boots)\\n\\nMy advice: go see the movie. It&apos;s magical and beautiful and funny. Then, if you are a Diana Wynne Jones fan, check out the rest of Miyazaki&apos;s films. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. If you are a Miyazaki fan, hie thee to a library or bookstore try Ms Jones&apos; books.

Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.\\n\\nThe subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character&apos;s utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew &quot;scary movies&quot; forevermore).  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.\\n\\nMy only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively.  That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).\\n\\nIn sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise).  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;d necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic.

However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.\\n\\nI have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.\\n\\nThe film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don&apos;t grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys&apos; tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.\\n\\nI feel that much of Gumps&apos; appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.\\n\\nThe movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest&apos;s character terms it very well with this quote,&quot;I think it is a little bit of both.&quot; From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way.

I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren&apos;t we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don&apos;t realize we are there?\\n\\nHitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window&apos; as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo&apos; (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock&apos;s mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa&apos;s nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle&apos;s reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom&apos;.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.\\n\\nHitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn&apos;t see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn&apos;t Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.\\n\\nThe acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden&apos; in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter&apos;s performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn&apos;t get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.\\n\\nThis film was rated number 42 on AFI&apos;s top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho&apos; (#18) and `Vertigo&apos; (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo&apos; but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10. `Rear Window&apos; is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 489506, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.5}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Mystery', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '1986-08-07', 'keywords': 'wheelchair,voyeur,apartment,amateur detective,based on short story', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1947451929', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUxMTU0NTEtNjc0Zi00NTZiLTljNjYtYzg4OGY5NzRhZDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUxMTU0NTEtNjc0Zi00NTZiLTljNjYtYzg4OGY5NzRhZDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1947451929/', 'description': 'A wheelchair-bound photographer spies on his neighbors from his Greenwich Village courtyard apartment window, and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder, despite the skepticism of his fashion-model girlfriend.', 'duration': 'PT2M39S', 'uploadDate': '2022-07-27T17:57:05.934Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000071/', 'name': 'James Stewart'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000038/', 'name': 'Grace Kelly'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0179819/', 'name': 'Wendell Corey'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000033/', 'name': 'Alfred Hitchcock'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0137799/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0371088/', 'name': 'John Michael Hayes'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0941280/', 'name': 'Cornell Woolrich'}], 'duration': 'PT1H52M'}\n",

A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.&quot; -Mark Twain\\n\\n&apos;Classic&apos; seems to be the word used to describe &quot;Scarface&quot;, Brian DePalma&apos;s 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida&apos;s drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film &apos;an epic gangster classic&apos; or &apos;eptiome of gangster films.&apos; When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.\\n\\nFirst off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma&apos;s directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. &apos;Tragedy&apos; would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it&apos;s drug usage, it&apos;s violence, it&apos;s dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn&apos;t make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.\\n\\nNext on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a &apos;gangster film&apos;. It has it&apos;s share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It&apos;s not like &quot;Aliens&quot;- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. \\n\\nThis being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn&apos;t think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma&apos;s direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping&apos; fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in &quot;Grease 2&quot; she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony&apos;s sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina&apos;s torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. \\n\\nThis reviewer learned one main thing when watching &quot;Scarface&quot; for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey&apos;s on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real &quot;Scarface.&quot;', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 833763, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': '18', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '1983-12-09', 'keywords': 'cocaine,gangster,cuban refugee,organized crime,murderer as protagonist', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Scarface: Blu-Ray', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3939802137', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJlYTQ1YWEtNGRkOS00NmZmLTkyNDItN2JkMWUzMGZkYzVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJlYTQ1YWEtNGRkOS00NmZmLTkyNDItN2JkMWUzMGZkYzVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3939802137/', 'description': 'F-Word Trailer for Scarface', 'duration': 'PT2M18S', 'uploadDate': '2011-07-22T03:31:05Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000199/', 'name': 'Al Pacino'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000201/', 'name': 'Michelle Pfeiffer'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000874/', 'name': 'Steven Bauer'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000361/', 'name': 'Brian De Palma'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0005073/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000231/', 'name': 'Oliver Stone'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001328/', 'name': 'Howard Hawks'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0372942/', 'name': 'Ben Hecht'}], 'duration': 'PT2H50M'}\n",

The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to &quot;clear&quot; the rear of Third Panzer Army).

Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.\\n\\nFor most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.\\n\\nThis is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. \\n\\nAmerica was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we&apos;re going through something similar today in many areas. We&apos;re moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It&apos;s progress I guess, but it takes its toll.\\n\\nSome factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they&apos;ve lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.\\n\\nHenry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. \\n\\nTom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he&apos;s known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he&apos;s not got all the answers, but he&apos;s asking the questions. Tom hasn&apos;t figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven&apos;t either. He only knows that he&apos;s got to get in the fight for economic justice.\\n\\nJane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She&apos;s what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That&apos;s what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.\\n\\nJohn Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn&apos;t seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda&apos;s been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man&apos;s place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He&apos;s developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine&apos;s questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.\\n\\nThe Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they&apos;re treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they&apos;re treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I&apos;ll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.\\n\\nGiven some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn&apos;t really all that much a relic of our past. It&apos;s both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 93495, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Drama'], 'datePublished': '1941-05-27', 'keywords': 'great depression,based on novel,capitalism,national film registry,bakersfield california', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'The Grapes of Wrath', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1686962457', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFkZDgzZDgtM2NjNS00Yjc0LWJmZTctZjZlMzcxN2FlYTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFkZDgzZDgtM2NjNS00Yjc0LWJmZTctZjZlMzcxN2FlYTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1686962457/', 'description': 'Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox', 'duration': 'PT2M22S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T16:25:25Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000020/', 'name': 'Henry Fonda'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0002034/', 'name': 'Jane Darwell'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001017/', 'name': 'John Carradine'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000406/', 'name': 'John Ford'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0000756/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0425913/', 'name': 'Nunnally Johnson'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0825705/', 'name': 'John Steinbeck'}], 'duration': 'PT2H9M'}\n",

The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.\\n\\nIt&apos;s very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town.

You haven&apos;t seen it all until you&apos;ve seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.\\n\\nThe movie didn&apos;t get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it&apos;s not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I&apos;ve asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.\\n\\nThe movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I&apos;ve seen it several times, but it&apos;s just as good as the first time I saw it.

A tribute to the previous masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.\\n\\nEastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guilt-filled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the town, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax, welcoming back a sort of &apos;Man With No Name&apos; character to the genre.\\n\\nWilliam Munny is a cold-blooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But, all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn&apos;t die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now, but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man, of which deserved it, he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination, he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.\\n\\nThe film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless (see Tarantino or Scorsese films) and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn&apos;t worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken, it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide (Munny and Little Bill) or kills someone and calls it a day (Kid and Logan), because they can&apos;t bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thought-provoking thing for me personally, ever.\\n\\nUnforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually, its the greatest film of all-time. It shows how violent it was back then, and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone&apos;s &apos;Man With No Name&apos; films (though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land). But, Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol; which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are, either cowards or killers. The choice of word &apos;coward&apos; is to say that they should be killers, as that is apparently what a man is (an exaggeration) as most westerns glorify violence, but the men can&apos;t handle it.\\n\\nClint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way; like when asked if he killed women and children he replied &quot;I&apos;ve killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another, and I&apos;m here to kill you\\x85&quot;. He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade, the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.\\n\\nThe script, written by David Webb Peoples, buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years, even being rejected by some of the cast, before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of &apos;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&apos; or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view, yet also being extremely raw. The score, though not used often is very refreshing and moving.\\n\\n&apos;Unforgiven&apos; is an unforgettable look on life, man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the &apos;90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.\\n\\n9/10', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 411081, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Western'], 'datePublished': '1993-02-19', 'keywords': 'revenge,revisionist western,one last job,sadist,gun control', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Official Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3445406489', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTRmNmQ1ZDQtNWJjZC00ZWFiLWE3OGEtNTQwMjVkMmRjNjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTRmNmQ1ZDQtNWJjZC00ZWFiLWE3OGEtNTQwMjVkMmRjNjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3445406489/', 'description': '', 'duration': 'PT2M37S', 'uploadDate': '2018-09-14T22:40:44.440Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000142/', 'name': 'Clint Eastwood'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000432/', 'name': 'Gene Hackman'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000151/', 'name': 'Morgan Freeman'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000142/', 'name': 'Clint Eastwood'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0002663/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0010258/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0672459/', 'name': 'David Webb Peoples'}], 'duration': 'PT2H10M'}\n",

Yet, that&apos;s how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.\\n\\nSean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can&apos;t stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he&apos;s great as a director, having seen his work in &quot;The Pledge&quot; and &quot;The Crossing Guard.&quot; The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays &quot;Chris McCandless&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Alexander Supertramp&quot; reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.\\n\\nTwo people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (&quot;Ron France&quot;) again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn&apos;t acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as &quot;Tracy Tatro,&quot; who had a crush on &quot;Alex.&quot; This young woman is on her way to stardom.\\n\\nBrian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, &quot;Rainey&quot; and &quot;Jan.&quot; I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker&apos;s voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.\\n\\nKnowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don&apos;t remember them in the book but I&apos;ll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here.

I personally love it, but I was underwhelmed by it first time. Persona is definitely not the most accessible of Ingmar Bergman&apos;s films, Wild Strawberries and The Magic Flute were much more in that regard, and it is also not an easy film to talk about or review. I have seen those who didn&apos;t like Persona finding that the story structure is disjointed. In a way it is, but what also made it fascinating in my view was how it explored the nature of art and reality in an ever thought-provoking(by Bergman standards) manner. Sven Nykvist&apos;s cinematography is fantastic, the melting frame was an interesting and well-done technique here, as is the scenery, and it is not a Bergman film with a memorable image or two. Persona definitely has those, with the disturbing and somewhat daring images at the start, the immortal image of the two main characters&apos; faces becoming an entity and the more retrospective one with Alma reminiscing with the sexual encounter. The score is hauntingly beautiful, and the way it&apos;s written Persona comes across(like Cries and Whispers) as emotionally complex, somewhat disturbing and very moving, and as ever thoughtful also. The inclusion of off-screen voices are well-incorporated. Bergman&apos;s direction I cannot fault, and it&apos;s the same with the two leading ladies. Liv Ullman proves that a performance where actions and gestures speak louder than words can still move you, and she does that splendidly. But for me it is Bibbi Andersson&apos;s film, she is just heart-breaking in her loyalty and compassion.

So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise', 'reviewBody': 'It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it&apos;s way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of &apos;Bat credit-cards&apos; and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. \\n\\nEnter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000&apos;s &apos;Momento&apos;, widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film&apos;s screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it&apos;s true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson&apos;s character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. \\n\\nNolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne&apos;s backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there&apos;s little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.\\n\\nOf course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne&apos;s skin, it doesn&apos;t hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne&apos;s public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.\\n\\nAnd the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It&apos;s very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It&apos;s not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne&apos;s mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne&apos;s arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It&apos;s wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his &apos;fear gas&apos; are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra&apos;s Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. \\n\\nNolan&apos;s knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it&apos;s environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don&apos;t think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan&apos;s realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There&apos;s even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What&apos;s not to love here?\\n\\n(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)\\n\\nOverall, I&apos;d have to label Batman Begins &apos;The must see movie of the summer&apos; - it&apos;s a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale&apos;s powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy&apos;s sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it&apos;s own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.\\n\\n-10/10', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1458671, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '12', 'genre': ['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama'], 'datePublished': '2005-07-14', 'keywords': 'superhero,social decay,origin of hero,dc comics,gotham', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': '4K Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi362988313', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJhYTcxYzgtOTI3My00ZTI1LWI3NzAtZTljMTFjM2ViOGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJhYTcxYzgtOTI3My00ZTI1LWI3NzAtZTljMTFjM2ViOGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi362988313/', 'description': 'After training with his mentor, Batman begins his fight to free crime-ridden Gotham City from corruption.', 'duration': 'PT1M12S', 'uploadDate': '2021-09-20T04:21:41.311Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000288/', 'name': 'Christian Bale'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000323/', 'name': 'Michael Caine'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0913822/', 'name': 'Ken Watanabe'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0634240/', 'name': 'Christopher Nolan'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0002663/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0147954/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0038332/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0004170/', 'name': 'Bob Kane'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0275286/', 'name': 'David S.

It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. \\n\\nThe opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane&apos;s story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn&apos;t even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. \\n\\nMarion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the &quot;protagonist&quot; victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion&apos;s sister&apos;s search. \\n\\nThe movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man&apos;s body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn&apos;t expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn&apos;t want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.\\n\\nThis film is mentioned in the documentary &quot;Moguls and Movie Stars&quot; as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. \\n\\nWeird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as &quot;man&quot; in Psycho, although I don&apos;t remember him ever mentioning it.

Well, &apos;nothing&apos; maybe a bit of an overstatement- the film is inventive and interesting otherwise but Bogart&apos;s performance makes the film. This film established his career, helping him escape the dozens of cheap crime films he was in prior to this film. It&apos;s easy to see why audiences were impressed with his charismatic portrayal of no-nonsense tough guy Sam Spade. I wasn&apos;t overly impressed with Mary Astor&apos;s performance in the film; she wasn&apos;t a compelling love interest and failed to live up to the script&apos;s strong characterization. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, however, completely make up for Astor&apos;s performance.\\n\\nThis film was John Huston&apos;s debut film, and it doesn&apos;t really feel like a debut film. It&apos;s quite accomplished, actually. The film is heavily stylized, perhaps more than any other film before it. It is also unflinching in its moral ambiguity (it was named the first film in the &apos;film-noir&apos; genre by French critic Nino Frank, though I think other films qualify such as Howard Hawks&apos; &quot;Scarface&quot;) portraying harsh, cruel, cold individuals. Sam Spade is a realistic character, stylized perhaps, but realistic. He is not the perfect John Wayne all-American hero; he is harsh, cold, and even capable of murder. When his partner is killed Spade does not feel much of anything, reacting indifferently to the death and even kissing his widow during their first meeting after he hears the news. John Huston wanted this film to be more character-based and less plot-based than the two previous adaptations of the novel (which he called &apos;wretched pictures&apos;). The care taken to provide good characterization in the script is clear to the audience. Indeed, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; has a fairly complicated plot and it&apos;s easy to understand how a film can get bogged down in the plot and fail to entertain the audience or even tell a good story. Huston made a wise choice in reducing the plot to the background and focusing on the characters and dialogue.\\n\\nHuston also pays close attention to visual composition of shots, painstakingly recreating the sleazy underbelly of San Francisco. San Francisco is traditionally used in film as a romantic setting, and it is remarkable how drastically different Huston&apos;s portrayal of the city is from the norm and how effective it is. Huston, after writing the very fun and smart script, storyboarded every scene in the film and the attention to detail is clear to those viewing the film. Often such meticulous planning carries over to the screen and interrupts the dramatic flow, but not in this case. The film flows exceptionally well and feels much shorter than its 100 minute running time. The result of all the care that went into the film is, by all accounts, excellent entertainment. It&apos;s smart, stylish, generally well-acted, and always captivating. &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; is surely one of the most promising debut films in history, promise and potential which Huston most certainly delivered on later in his career.\\n\\n****/4'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 158877, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Film-Noir', 'Mystery'], 'datePublished': '1941-10-18', 'keywords': 'private detective,directorial debut,maltese falcon,murder,statuette', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'The Maltese Falcon', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1811284249', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFhZTdjYmUtZWI4YS00MjY2LTllZjctOTc0ZGIzZmI0ZjE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFhZTdjYmUtZWI4YS00MjY2LTllZjctOTc0ZGIzZmI0ZjE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1811284249/', 'description': 'Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it&apos;s beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it&apos;s easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.\\n\\nJust that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about &apos;Hacksaw Ridge&apos; in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).\\n\\nHowever this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of &apos;Saving Private Ryan&apos; a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn&apos;t quite as good).\\n\\nThroughout &apos;Hacksaw Ridge&apos; has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams&apos; score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.\\n\\nFor a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.\\n\\nAndrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese&apos;s &apos;Silence&apos;), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn&apos;t but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 520155, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '18', 'genre': ['Biography', 'Drama', 'History'], 'datePublished': '2016-12-29', 'keywords': 'world war two,conscientious objector,soldier,medic,1940s', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer #1', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2608248601', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNTI5MzQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc3OTY1OTE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNTI5MzQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc3OTY1OTE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2608248601/', 'description': '&apos;Hacksaw Ridge&apos; is the true story of Desmond Doss who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun.

I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I&apos;m not a great one for old &quot;classics&quot;. This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven&apos;t seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror&apos;s complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda&apos;s concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that&apos;s a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney&apos;s characters such as Piglet.

A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.\\n\\nIn contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick&apos;s other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.\\n\\nThe light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers&apos; headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.\\n\\nThe use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive \\x96 all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite \\x96 a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.\\n\\nThe casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn&apos;t a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.\\n\\nThroughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier&apos;s bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else \\x96 the icing on the cake. However it&apos;s quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus.

Seen in context of its premier in 1927, Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history.  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great, and in particular, Metropolis.  A great film is one that stirs the imagination, leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever, forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life, and achieves a kind of immortality.  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria.  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings, halluciatory scenes, and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope, most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions.  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria.  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual, as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups.  Lastly, Metropolis has stood the test of time.  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre.  The story itself is simple,a Biblical allegory, about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen.  The film is anything but simple.

Grifters are the small-time con artists who work the streets.  They know and respect one another, and the death of Luther brings all the con men from far and wide together in a plan of revenge.  Doyle Lonnegan is the New York Irish gangster who ordered Luther&apos;s execution, so the grifters target him for the &quot;big con&quot;.\\n\\n    &quot;The Sting&quot; was devised as a follow-up to &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot;, reuniting Newman and Redford as lovable, wisecracking rogues.  The motivation behind the project may have been cynical box-office manipulation, but the resulting film is a beauty.  The two stars make a great team, and multi-faceted confidence tricks adorn the plot in Byzantine complexity.\\n\\n    Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) has two prominent personality traits - greed and cruelty.  A con is put together which will use these characteristics against their owner.  The best way to hurt Lonnegan is to dupe him out of his money, because the sharks of the criminal fraternity will turn on him once they see that he&apos;s been &apos;had&apos;.  It is essential that Lonnegan must never know that this was a scam, because if he did, he would pursue a vendetta against our heroes.  He must believe that he lost his money through his own stupidity, and that the men who took it are now dead.\\n\\n    The opening scenes emphasise the harshness of a world in which powerful crooks fleece ordinary joes, but also stress the warmth of the social bond which unites the small-time thieves.  Mottola is a runner for Lonnegan&apos;s operation, a heartless dandy who steals a desperate man&apos;s dough (or so he thinks).  The gambling dens ruthlessly swindle Hooker out of his money, but Hooker makes no trouble for the croupier, a guy just like himself who is merely trying to survive.\\n\\n    Redford plays Hooker to perfection.  He is the handsome, charming &apos;man of the people&apos;.  There is no malice in him, and yet he spends his life ducking, diving and dodging lead.  Luther was his father figure, and we see Hooker transfer his filial allegiance to Gondorff.\\n\\n    The film is crammed with technical cleverness.  Whoever went out and scouted for locations did a great job, because the gritty 1930&apos;s look is wonderful.  If the streets around the bookie&apos;s shop were &apos;faked&apos; on a back lot, then this alone would make &quot;The Sting&quot; outstanding.  Watch the urban period detail as Lonnegan goes across to place his first bet, and again at the start of &quot;The Wire&quot;.  Hooker suddenly realises that Luther is dead, and we see &apos;the penny drop&apos; by means of a very simple but very effective device - the camera zooms back.  No redundant dialogue, no over-acting.  The panoramic view from above the rail tracks is achieved by &apos;masking in&apos; a photograph of old Joliet, to create a convincing skyline.  During the poker game on the train, the focus is thrown from Lonnegan&apos;s cards to Gondorff&apos;s eyes.  We know that Gondorff knows that Lonnegan is cheating.\\n\\n    The music cannot go unmentioned.  Apart from being exquisite, it contributes a major part of the film&apos;s overall feel.  &quot;The Sting&quot; introduced the piano rags of Scott Joplin to a mass audience, and their popularity has not diminished over the ensuing decades.  Composed perhaps forty years before the events they illustrate, and therefore &apos;wrong&apos; from a period point of view, the pieces are none the less perfect, and the film is unimaginable without them.  As a fun accompaniment to the music, the film contains various silent-era &apos;wipes&apos;.  Watch for the changes of scene for the iris-ins and iris-outs, and vertical and horizontal wipes.\\n\\n    David Ward&apos;s script is intelligent and intricate.  The &apos;big con&apos; has safety features built into it, such as the well-worked &apos;shut-out&apos;.  In order for the audience to take the swindlers to their hearts, it is necessary to depict the cops as venal, immoral and downright sleazy.  Local dick Snyder is all of this, and more, his character being a masterpiece of dimwitted malevolence.\\n\\n    Eileen Brennan (Captain Lewis in &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;) plays Billie, Gondorff&apos;s partner.  She turns in a performance of cool assurance, one of the film&apos;s subtler treats.  Charles Dierkop is simply marvellous as Floyd. This veteran of &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; has hardly any dialogue, but he makes Floyd central to the film&apos;s comic purpose - and does it all with nuances of gesture.  The FBI agents are great.  Wearing straw boaters more than a decade after straw boaters ceased to be cool, and persisting with them even in torrential rain, the G-men are the archetype of Hooverian &apos;squareness&apos;.\\n\\n    It may be fanciful, but are there passing references to Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Strangers On A Train&quot;?

The numbers that follow are more low-key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed.\\n\\nThe stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable. They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre (jazz) while too often being told it is &quot;a dying art&quot;.\\n\\nGosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it&apos;s not long before he fits into the part quite nicely. Stone is superb throughout the film. She is even spot-on as an actress giving mediocre auditions. She&apos;s given a full range - and not just as a triple threat - and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song &quot;Audition&quot; near the end.\\n\\nThere is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself. The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Les Demoiselles de Rochefort&quot;, and &quot;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&quot; all the while being unique and standing out on its own. In addition, the set designs and photography add further to the film&apos;s greatness.\\n\\nThe reference to &quot;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&quot; comes through strongly in the movie&apos;s final number. This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016. It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side.

I&apos;ve never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn&apos;t really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or &apos;American&apos;). I can&apos;t imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn&apos;t, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli&apos;s - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. \\n\\nBUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki&apos;s I&apos;ve seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It&apos;s simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It&apos;s not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking. \\n\\nI appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It&apos;s pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the &apos;subtitle demon&apos; (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it&apos;s not the subtitles that are way off? They&apos;re probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.\\n\\nA fair question might be, &apos;if it&apos;s so bad why was it so successful?&apos; The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it&apos;s the biggest grossing film in history. &apos;Go figure,&apos; as Chihiro wouldn&apos;t say.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 754744, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.6}, 'contentRating': 'KN', 'genre': ['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Family'], 'datePublished': '2003-03-06', 'keywords': 'spirit world,studio ghibli,child protagonist,falling from height,real name', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Spirited Away', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3619684633', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzZjOWEyNTEtNjhmMC00YmZlLTkyMzAtM2Y5MzFjYmJlODIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzZjOWEyNTEtNjhmMC00YmZlLTkyMzAtM2Y5MzFjYmJlODIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3619684633/', 'description': 'CT #2A Post', 'duration': 'PT1M35S', 'uploadDate': '2008-08-04T03:46:33Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0153738/', 'name': 'Daveigh Chase'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0687189/', 'name': 'Suzanne Pleshette'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0997115/', 'name': 'Miyu Irino'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0594503/', 'name': 'Hayao Miyazaki'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0016626/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0048420/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0003850/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0594503/', 'name': 'Hayao Miyazaki'}], 'duration': 'PT2H5M'}\n",

This Billy Wilder&apos;s first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby&apos;s policy contains a clause that states that if the husband&apos;s death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator&apos;s boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .\\n\\nThis first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain&apos;s book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain&apos;s novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film&apos;s script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn&apos;t really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson&apos;s initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn&apos;t keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler&apos;s cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .\\n\\nExciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for ¨Body heat¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 157346, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.3}, 'contentRating': 'Passed', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Drama', 'Film-Noir'], 'datePublished': '1947-05-29', 'keywords': 'insurance investigation,murder disguised as accident,femme fatale,insurance,insurance policy', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Double Indemnity', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2244780569', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY0YzAzMTktNTIxOS00MGNkLWI0MGEtOWQ3OTRmNDY1Y2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY0YzAzMTktNTIxOS00MGNkLWI0MGEtOWQ3OTRmNDY1Y2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2244780569/', 'description': 'Trailer for Double Indemnity', 'duration': 'PT2M16S', 'uploadDate': '2012-05-19T03:11:42Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0534045/', 'name': 'Fred MacMurray'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001766/', 'name': 'Barbara Stanwyck'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000064/', 'name': 'Edward G.

On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn&apos;t always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the &quot;stolen kiss on the beach at night&quot; and &quot;Cue the sun!&quot;\\n\\nIn the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current &quot;reality TV&quot; obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.

Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don&apos;t know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.\\n\\n It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW&apos;s were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant&apos;s uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW&apos;s built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn&apos;t fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. \\n\\nAs for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW&apos;s wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.\\n\\nAs for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW&apos;s participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it&apos;s true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio&apos;s bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see &quot;Hart&apos;s War&quot; where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).\\n\\nAll in all, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances.

They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of over-plotted special effects-laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet - this is when art is achieved.\\n\\n&quot;Children of Heaven&quot; has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier &quot;The White Balloon&quot; but the original Italian classic, &quot;The Bicycle Thief.&quot; In this film, young Ali accidentally loses his sister&apos;s recently mended shoes; out of this tale of utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes: the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy, its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.\\n\\nThe actors, children and adults alike, underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.\\n\\n&quot;Children of Heaven&quot; brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don&apos;t miss &quot;Children of Heaven&quot;!

The film was a hit at the box office and won all sorts of critical acclaim but I still think the film is quite underrated as it&apos;s one of the most draining and emotional films ever made. It&apos;s certainly not a fun or pleasant movie to watch but there&apos;s no question that Cimino made something incredibly powerful and at times shocking.\\n\\nThe film might have been praised but some threw a lot of criticism at it including some of the Vietnam scenes dealing with the Russian roulette. Many have said that the most powerful scenes in the movie were nothing more than a work of fiction but I find this to be a rather silly complaint because this was a movie and not a documentary. These scenes are some of the most powerful moments in film history so to say the film would have been better off without them is rather stupid. The scenes in Vietnam with the solders being forced to play against one another are among the most intense scenes you will ever see.\\n\\nAnother bit of criticism is aimed at Cimino and his decision to make the wedding sequence last for fifty-two minutes. Personally speaking, I think this was a great decision and the other two-thirds of the film wouldn&apos;t have been as powerful without such a long opening. Not only do we get to know all of the characters involved but a lot of the stuff that happens here pays off later in the movie. One of the most powerful and telling scenes deals with a soldier who comes to drink at the bar and is confronted by DeNiro. I&apos;m obviously not going to spoil anything but this plays an important part later in the picture on the mental state of his character.\\n\\nSpeaking of DeNiro, he once again delivers a marvelous performance and especially since he&apos;s the main character in the movie and must play so many different emotions. The actor perfectly nails the character and really brings a lot of heart and soul to the picture. The ensemble cast really does a remarkable job here with Meryl Streep showing what greatness was to come with her. Walken deserved his Oscar for his heartbreaking performance. Savage, George Dzundza, Chuck Aspegren and John Cazale are all equally wonderful as well.\\n\\nTechnically speaking the film is quite flawless with some masterful cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond as well as a haunting and incredibly moving score by Stanley Myers. THE DEER HUNTER is without question one of the most depressing and emotionally draining movies that you&apos;ll ever see but it&apos;s also a masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever created.'}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 338779, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'War'], 'datePublished': '1990-03-01', 'keywords': 'russian roulette,vietnam war veteran,vietnam war,wedding reception,soldier', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'The Deer Hunter', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3045785881', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUzNDllZDctZTQxYy00NDVlLWJlYjAtOGUwNmY4OTIxOGVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUzNDllZDctZTQxYy00NDVlLWJlYjAtOGUwNmY4OTIxOGVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3045785881/', 'description': 'Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures', 'duration': 'PT2M45S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T16:18:21Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000134/', 'name': 'Robert De Niro'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000686/', 'name': 'Christopher Walken'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001030/', 'name': 'John Cazale'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001047/', 'name': 'Michael Cimino'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0103338/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0005073/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0001047/', 'name': 'Michael Cimino'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0913346/', 'name': 'Deric Washburn'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0307311/', 'name': 'Louis Garfinkle'}], 'duration': 'PT3H3M'}\n",

It&apos;s worth watching, and will probably win you over.\\n\\nTaking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot;-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers&apos; over-the-top faux-Scots accent, &quot;Shrek&quot; shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon&apos;s target audience while registering with their parents. &apos;Sure it&apos;s big enough, but look at the location,&apos; Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love &apos;Shrek&apos; every bit as much. It&apos;s impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.\\n\\nMyers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He&apos;s a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.\\n\\nCameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn&apos;t have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she&apos;s given.\\n\\nThe comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek&apos;s donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he&apos;s never been this funny since the first &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; movie. &quot;We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I&apos;m making waffles,&quot; the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.\\n\\nWhy exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn&apos;t clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams &quot;plot convenience,&quot; and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.\\n\\nBut the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won&apos;t notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.\\n\\nThis is not a Disney movie, something &quot;Shrek&quot; makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of &quot;It&apos;s A Small World&quot;-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, &quot;Shrek&quot; could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture&apos;s freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 672964, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 7.9}, 'contentRating': 'KN', 'genre': ['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy'], 'datePublished': '2001-06-21', 'keywords': 'onion,epic,exploding animal,ethnic cleansing,tearjerker', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Shrek', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi4085711129', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU5ZDE5NTItN2I1YS00ZmFmLTk3YTgtNzQwOGNkYzFjOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU5ZDE5NTItN2I1YS00ZmFmLTk3YTgtNzQwOGNkYzFjOWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi4085711129/', 'description': 'Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks', 'duration': 'PT2M6S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T16:05:20Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000196/', 'name': 'Mike Myers'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000552/', 'name': 'Eddie Murphy'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000139/', 'name': 'Cameron Diaz'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0011470/', 'name': 'Andrew Adamson'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0421776/', 'name': 'Vicky Jenson'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0129164/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0819670/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0069464/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0825308/', 'name': 'William Steig'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0254645/', 'name': 'Ted Elliott'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0744429/', 'name': 'Terry Rossio'}], 'duration': 'PT1H30M'}\n",

Yes, it&apos;s fair to say that &apos;Gone Girl&apos; is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it&apos;s based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven&apos;t read the book, so I haven&apos;t got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don&apos;t care. I just enjoyed the ride.\\n\\n&apos;Gone Girl&apos; is one of those films where you don&apos;t want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven&apos;t seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It&apos;s fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what&apos;s coming.\\n\\nMany people don&apos;t really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he&apos;s due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You&apos;ll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you&apos;ll have to see whether she&apos;s found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you&apos;re just confused enough never to put too much together before the film&apos;s ready to reveal what&apos;s happening.\\n\\nIf I had one complaint it&apos;s that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that&apos;s a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 8}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 974758, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '2014-10-02', 'keywords': 'missing person,disappearance,murder suspect,husband wife relationship,based on novel', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'TV Spot', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1298770969', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMwOTk3MDI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTYzOTM1MjE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMwOTk3MDI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTYzOTM1MjE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1298770969/', 'description': 'Watch a TV spot Gone Girl.', 'duration': 'PT1M', 'uploadDate': '2014-08-27T10:06:04Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000255/', 'name': 'Ben Affleck'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0683253/', 'name': 'Rosamund Pike'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000439/', 'name': 'Neil Patrick Harris'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000399/', 'name': 'David Fincher'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0000756/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0007127/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0420822/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm5058839/', 'name': 'Gillian Flynn'}], 'duration': 'PT2H29M'}\n",

In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America&apos;s system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he&apos;s calling to hustle you at home and you don&apos;t even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort&apos;s lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That&apos;s the way it works, and it&apos;s impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.\\n\\nThere is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.\\n\\nThe direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.\\n\\nThe script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort&apos;s character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex &amp; drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort&apos;s sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort&apos;s second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort&apos;s mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.\\n\\nMartin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that &quot;most-addictive drug&quot; Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one&apos;s lifestyle but the effects it has on one&apos;s morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.\\n\\nWith a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese&apos;s best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that&apos;s already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it&apos;s one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1388697, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.2}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Biography', 'Comedy', 'Crime'], 'datePublished': '2013-12-26', 'keywords': 'based on true story,stockbroker,female nudity,debauchery,extramarital affair', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Trailer #2', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2312218649', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1OTQ5NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI5NTI1MDE@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1OTQ5NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI5NTI1MDE@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2312218649/', 'description': 'The story of New York stockbroker Jordan Belfort.

It&apos;s multi-faceted and challenging and she definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She&apos;s got a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is an actress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of her career, like when she was in that television show &quot;Promised Land.&quot; But Addison DeWitt - takes the cake.

Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It&apos;s a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.\\n\\nThe Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn&apos;t, for at times it&apos;s a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.\\n\\nThe Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it&apos;s a film that shouldn&apos;t be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it&apos;s a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.\\n\\nThe film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I&apos;m being sent spinning into another world, that&apos;s the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I&apos;m in hook line and sinker.\\n\\nThere are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!\\n\\nOne of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy&apos;s Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie.

They are not nourishing, but they&apos;re delicious.\\n\\nThis is how I feel about this film. If I make a conscious attempt at explaining why I like &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, I can see no real meat in it. I got no lessons from the flick, I hardly got a story... Forget what others say about this movie as &quot;philosophical&quot;, &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;trascendent&quot;. It&apos;s not. But, my!, how such a young director almost manages to make you believe it is... I don&apos;t know about you, but I call that talent.\\n\\nYes, the movie is empty. The story goes nowhere, there is no message, no moral, but the way it&apos;s all wrapped up keeps you salivating throughout. Don&apos;t think it&apos;s mere flashy fireworks, though. This is not a case of style over substance. It&apos;s something more complex, and that&apos;s where &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; distances from the rest. This movie is freaking special, is full of personality. I wish more films had this character. The charm of this film relies on a lot of pieces that fit like a giant puzzle: \\n\\n-Chosen time (1988) is strangely proper (you&apos;ll have to see this movie to understand it, sorry).\\n\\n-The movie is BLUE. Its photography is blue, its characters are blue, its story is blue. Everything is blue.\\n\\n-Music is great.\\n\\n-Emotions are overwhelming. They come from everywhere and at the same time. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening, but what might be happening actually affects you.\\n\\n-I can see some Lynch influences. The scene where the gym teacher talks to Donnie&apos;s mother at the doorstep is 100% Lynch.\\n\\n-Some scenes are, almost, scary.\\n\\n-This is one of the movies that present the idea of &quot;beyond&quot; in a most seductive way. You feel there&apos;s something more than this world. It never gets explained, but heck, I don&apos;t care.\\n\\n-Finally, and most important, the main appeal of the movie is that it throws together unrelated concepts in such a way that they feel ghostly linked. The movie is a melting pot of vague ideas, that, thanks to a great direction, get connected in the subconscious.\\n\\nExactly because of this, I understand this movie has so much appeal for some people, and so little for others. If you fall in the trap, it will touch you, and this movie could mean the world to you. If you don&apos;t, it won&apos;t, and you won&apos;t see more than a bag of tricks. Whatever the category you fall in, you have to recognize the skill of Richard Kelly. The execution of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is more than remarkable.\\n\\nI like to think of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; not as a movie, but as a niche some people feel comfortably unsafe inside, that people being 25-30 year olds with an affection for sci-fi and darkness.

It&apos;s not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.\\n\\nInstead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese&apos;s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.\\n\\nNicholson&apos;s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn&apos;t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.\\n\\nGetting this man won&apos;t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.\\n\\nBut the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren&apos;t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. \\n\\nScorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. \\n\\nWahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn&apos;t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.\\n\\nThe real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson&apos;s character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson&apos;s character has survived in many ways, that&apos;s all I can say.\\n\\nScorsese has a nice feel for Boston&apos;s atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn&apos;t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won&apos;t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 10}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 1314293, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.5}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller'], 'datePublished': '2006-11-09', 'keywords': 'police,mobster,irish mafia,organized crime,scene of the crime', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Home Video Trailer', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2760573209', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwYWQ4NWItZjc3MC00Y2YyLWI2ZDgtMWE3ZjQxZDA2NzMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwYWQ4NWItZjc3MC00Y2YyLWI2ZDgtMWE3ZjQxZDA2NzMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2760573209/', 'description': 'Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video', 'duration': 'PT31S', 'uploadDate': '2008-04-11T16:18:33Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000138/', 'name': 'Leonardo DiCaprio'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000354/', 'name': 'Matt Damon'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000197/', 'name': 'Jack Nicholson'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000217/', 'name': 'Martin Scorsese'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0002663/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0136967/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0011877/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm1184258/', 'name': 'William Monahan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0538320/', 'name': 'Alan Mak'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0159039/', 'name': 'Felix Chong'}], 'duration': 'PT2H31M'}\n",

After being lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work, he was subsequently drugged, locked in chains, viciously beaten, stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who treated him in contrasting ways. The first was a relatively civilized fellow, but the plantation&apos;s half-witted manager was threatened by Northup&apos;s superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a dangerously volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment, Northup&apos;s owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This unbalanced individual regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit, which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his capricious moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.\\n\\nIt&apos;s noteworthy that a British director has become one of the few filmmakers to delve deeply into this subject, and the combination of John Ridley&apos;s powerful script and McQueen&apos;s directorial skills has inspired exceptional performances from the entire cast. Their dramatization of Northup&apos;s experiences is both riveting and uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a society that permitted such a barbaric system.

The film is loaded with celebrities such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon. Ocean&apos;s Eleven is very &quot;loosely&quot; based on the original Ocean&apos;s Eleven starring Frank Sinatra. Steven Soderbergh did a fabulous job directing this movie and having all the characters to connect to Danny Oceans group of 11. The plan is to steal 160$ million dollars from three Las Vegas Casino&apos;s. Sounds wacky? The planning time took up most of the movie, and you almost believe that it could be done after you see this. Andy Garcia did a fabulous job playing Terry Benedict, the owner of the Casino&apos;s where Ocean (Clooney) plans to rob. Brad Pitt plays and interesting role as Danny Ocean&apos;s sidekick. The plot flows quickly and some parts leave you laughing on the floor. Each one of the eleven characters had its own story behind them and it is seen when Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and Danny Ocean (Clooney) first go to recruit them to plan this heist. I have to say Julia Roberts didn&apos;t have a flexible character but nonetheless her presence in this film as Tess, Danny Ocean&apos;s ex-wife, is apparent.

A shrewd examination of the brutality of war and the duality of man in conflict.', 'review': {'@type': 'Review', 'itemReviewed': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'url': '/title/tt0091763/'}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'tomgillespie2002'}, 'dateCreated': '2016-10-27', 'inLanguage': 'English', 'name': 'Still packs a punch 30 years on', 'reviewBody': 'Ever since Steven Spielberg wowed the cinematic world and changed the aesthetic of the war movie forever with the exceptional opening 25 minutes of 1998&apos;s Saving Private Ryan - the film went downhill from there - audiences have come to expect the same grainy camera-work and ultra-realism of Spielberg&apos;s breathtaking vision whenever a battle is depicted. Anything else would be &apos;unrealistic&apos;, and many movies dated horribly almost overnight as a result. While Oliver Stone&apos;s Platoon, which was once considered difficult to watch due to its unflinching depiction of the insanity of war, may not seem quite as brutal as it used to, it possesses one thing that no war other movie can boast - the guiding hand of a veteran.\\n\\nStone did a tour in Vietnam which ended in 1968, changing the future writer/director forever. Starting out life as a screenplay focusing on a soldier&apos;s experiences both before and during the war which had Jim Morrison touted for the lead, it evolved into a movie focused solely on a young volunteer&apos;s time spent in the sweaty, eternally damp jungle. Charlie Sheen&apos;s Chris Taylor is an obvious stand-in for Stone, and he arrives fresh-faced and eager to fight for his country. By the end, he is dazed and confused, and angry at the country who would send such &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; men - invisible in society - into a world of such horror and meaningless bloodshed. It&apos;s an experience that moulded Stone into the one of the most outspoken voices in cinema.\\n\\nThe casting of the two sergeants vying for Chris&apos; soul is a stroke of genius. The platoon is made up of two main groups - the &apos;juicers&apos;, a collection of beer-swilling meat-heads seemingly intent on violence at every opportunity, and the &apos;heads&apos;, a more laid-back and weary bunch who are happiest when getting high and having a singalong. At the head of the juicers is Sgt. Barnes, played by Tom Berenger, an actor known for his heart-throb leading-man roles but here cast as a dead-eyed, heavily scarred brute. While Willem Dafoe, who was and still is known for his crazy-eyed villainous roles, plays the wiser, gentler leader of the heads, an all-round good guy battling his own demons. By toying with expectations, Stone adds layers to their characters, and they both received Best Actor nominations for their efforts.\\n\\nYet what makes Platoon truly stand out 30 years after its release is the way Stone manages to transport the audience to that terrible place. It&apos;s teeming with dangers at every turn, be it the ants, the snakes or the Viet Cong better equipped for the harsh surroundings, the most frightening moment is when they fall asleep. And even when they awake, there&apos;s something moving in the shadows. The film never allows you to ever be at ease, despite the fun to be had with spotting the many famous faces dotted throughout the supporting cast. There are flaws, especially with some overacting from some of the supporting cast - in particular John C. McGinley - and Chris&apos; unnecessary, rambling narration, but the movie packs such a punch that it&apos;s easy to forget these quibbles. It&apos;s a true insight into the mind of a grunt and how combat can have a lasting, eye-opening effect on those on the ground, and undoubtedly one of the most important war pictures ever to come out of the US.', 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': 1, 'bestRating': 10, 'ratingValue': 9}}, 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingCount': 413339, 'bestRating': 10, 'worstRating': 1, 'ratingValue': 8.1}, 'contentRating': '16', 'genre': ['Drama', 'War'], 'datePublished': '1988-09-01', 'keywords': 'vietnam war,gore,american war crimes,combat fatigue,tropics', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Platoon: Blu-ray Release', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi212245529', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDAxOWViMmYtMmI2ZC00YTA0LWIxMzAtNjBmMjgzMTAxN2ViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDAxOWViMmYtMmI2ZC00YTA0LWIxMzAtNjBmMjgzMTAxN2ViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi212245529/', 'description': '30 second Trailer', 'duration': 'PT31S', 'uploadDate': '2011-06-16T03:26:42Z'}, 'actor': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000221/', 'name': 'Charlie Sheen'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000297/', 'name': 'Tom Berenger'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000353/', 'name': 'Willem Dafoe'}], 'director': [{'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000231/', 'name': 'Oliver Stone'}], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0056805/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0779514/'}, {'@type': 'Organization', 'url': '/company/co0043707/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'url': '/name/nm0000231/', 'name': 'Oliver Stone'}], 'duration': 'PT2H'}\n",
